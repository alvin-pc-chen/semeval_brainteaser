Question 118: A full water glass was in the hands of the magician. Without spilling a single drop of water, he held the glass above his head and allowed it to fall to the carpet. How did he accomplish dropping the glass from a height of six feet without any water spilling?
Choices: 0 = The glass is too heavy.; 1 = There is no wine in the glass.; 2 = Surface tension prevents wine from spilling.; 3 = None of above.; 
Model Output: The question does not provide an accurate answer among the choices. Surface tension wouldn't prevent water from spilling if the glass falls from six feet. The weight of the glass is irrelevant. If the glass had been filled with a substance other than water, the problem statement would have indicated it. However, none of above does not provide an explanation either. Therefore, none of the provided choices answer the question correctly. The answer is 3.

Model Output: Submarines are designed to sink or 'submerge' in water as a part of their operations. If there was no external influence like a storm or a mechanical problem, it may still sink if it is a submarine. The answer is 2.
Corresponding Answer: 2 = It was a Submarine.
Correct Answer: 1 = The man was on a bridge when he first saw the train so he couldn't jump off the track immediately.
