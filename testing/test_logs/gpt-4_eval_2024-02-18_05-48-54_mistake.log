System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen?
                Choices: 0 = His hair is dyed.; 1 = This man is bald.; 2 = This man walk upside down to avoid rain.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Samuel got wet from the rain, but no hair on his head got wet. If Samuel dyed his hair it would still be wet. Samuel is bald, so his hair didn't get wet. The answer is 1
                Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: That the rope is not tied to anything else is the simplest choice. The horse can reach the hay whenever he chooses. The answer is 1
                Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time. If the woman did not get divorced or legally separated, she cannot be legally married to more than one person. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?
                Choices: 0 = Old money weight more than new money.; 1 = Old money is dirtier than new money.; 2 = Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: 1968 and 1967 refer to the number of pennies. The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies. The answer is 2
                Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come?
                Choices: 0 = The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 1 = The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 2 = The teacher was in an orphanage school.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even if the teacher had informed all the parents or all the students in advance about the unique disciplinary approach, it is unlikely that nobody would object. If the teacher is in an orphange school, there would be no parents to object. The answer is 2
                Question: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?
                Choices: 0 = Home.; 1 = The way to the pond.; 2 = Pond.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them are lost, 27 - 5 = 22. Thirteen of them are staying home, 22 - 13 = 9. Nine of them are at the pond, 9 - 9 = 0. There are no more ducks so the question is invalid. The answer is 3
                Question: How many birth days does the average person have?
                Choices: 0 = People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.; 1 = They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.; 2 = It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Everyone is born only once so technically the average person has one birthday in their lifetime. The answer is 1
                Question: The more you take, the more you leave behind
                Choices: 0 = Love.; 1 = Footsteps.; 2 = Money.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Footsteps. The more you walk, the more footsteps you leave behind. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lazy farmer being the mother of the diligent farmer is the simplest and most logical explanation. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The layout of the room and the objects found suggest that Romeo and Juliet might not be human. The glass shards, some water, and a single bookcase suggest an overturned fishbowl. The phrase "Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive." is therefore the most plausible. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): Every day before your birthday, you are technically one year younger than you will be tomorrow. Hence, this happens every year. The answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sporting organization, the captain would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): People who have unlisted phone numbers do not have their numbers in the phone directory. So, if you choose 100 names from the phone directory, nobody from your selection should have an unlisted phone number because their numbers are listed in the directory. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards are not necessarily standing back to back. If they were facing each other, one could see the other's face and see whether or not he was smiling. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Houses can't jump, making any height a dog can jump higher than a house. The question did not imply that the dog had to jump over the house, just higher than it could possibly jump. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you divide 100 by 10, you get 10. If you divide the result by 10 again, you get 1. After this, you can continue dividing by 10, but you won't get whole numbers anymore. So, technically, you can only divide 100 by 10 to get a whole number result twice. Therefore, the answer is 2

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is ambiguous as it doesn't provide enough information for a final answer. It mentions that there are more criminals than the police can fit in prisons, but does not give any value or relation between the number of criminals and the police force or the prison's capacity. Also, there's no stated correlation between the namebook and the overall population of criminals. Thus, we can't determine the exact number of criminals the police can find. The answer is 3.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year every year. Christmas is on December 25 and New Year's Day is on January 1 of the following year. So they always fall in the same year. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male chickens, they don't lay eggs. Therefore, no matter how much food the farmer provided, the roosters couldn't lay eggs. The answer is 1.

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): There is no information about the type of playground, Mark's preferences, or his proximity to different players given in the question. Therefore, it's not possible to infer why he chose to take a photo with the football player. The answer is 3.

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man that stayed dry is in a coffin. This works if the people at church were there for a funeral and the man in the coffin was the one being buried. The answer is 2

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): If she was at a zoo, the bears would be enclosed and thus wouldn't pose a threat to the woman. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the two houses were next to each other, wall-to-wall, he could have technically "jumped" from one house to another. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the attorney is the accountant's brother, and the attorney says he does not have a brother, then the only possible explanation is that the accountant is his sister, because she can still be his sibling without being his brother. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant said that the attorney was her brother, but the attorney said he did not have a brother. This is possible if the accountant is his sister. The answer is 0

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The group consists of a grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter. So, there are two mothers (the grandmother and the mother) and two daughters (the daughter and the granddaughter), but in total, there are only three people. Therefore, they can divide the $21 equally amongst themselves. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): In this case, the trick lies in the question, as it doesn't specify the gender of the other half of the children. If half of them are boys, it's logical that they could all be boys. So, the answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): You took the first medicine right away, the second one half an hour later, and the third one a half hour after that, so you kept going for one hour. The answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): A house cannot jump. Hence, even a small jump from the dog is higher than the house. The answer is 0

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the student is not wearing rubber boots, there are many ways their feet could be soaked, particularly if the terrain is wet. If the ground isn't wet, however, the student's feet will stay dry. So, the answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs, so it would be impossible for the rooster to lay an egg. The answer is 1.

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If James was surrounded by several hungry bears who simply looked at him and left, he could be at the zoo where they are behind bars or glass walls, so they can't harm him. The temperature and James's health is irrelevant to why the bears left him alone. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill right away, half an hour later you take the second, and half an hour after that, you take the third. So in total the pills last you for one hour. The answer is 1

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Once. After you subtract 10 from 100 once, it isn't 100 anymore. The answer is 0

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they are not twins but born on the same day from the same parents and they are from the same family, then the only explanation left is they must be triplets or more. The answer is 0

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Romeo and Juliet are referred to as fish in this context. This is apparent from the pieces of glass and water found on the floor - this came from the fish tank that was knocked off the shelf from the vibration of the nearby train. The fish could not survive without their tank filled with water. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the vice coach is unable to attend, the coach will likely take the lead role, not the captain or the team's management. The answer is 0

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement "No John, not the gun!" indicates that the shooter is likely named John. The policeman wouldn't know their relationship status or assume names based on professions, but he might distinguish individuals by gender. If the mail man was the only male and the doctor and lawyer were females, then the mail man must be John. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): The question's general assumption that old people eat more than young people is not universally correct. Individuals' dietary needs and consumption vary regardless of age based on factors such as health condition, metabolism, physical activity, etc. Therefore, the assumption in the question may not be necessarily correct. The answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack was a fish in the ocean. A sudden wave knocked him out of the water, and as a fish, he cannot survive outside of water so he died five minutes later. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The explanation is not about the physique of the dogs or their responsibilities. It's about their gender roles in family. The Fat dog can't be the father of the small dog in this case because the fat dog is the mother. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male, so they can't lay eggs. Therefore, the egg didn't roll on any side. The answer is 2

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the given answers logically explain why the one person did not get wet. The most reasonable explanation could be that the person was already under a cover, but this option is not presented. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): They could be one daughter, one mother and one grandmother. The mother is also the daughter of the grandmother, so there are just three people. Each person would receive $7. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted phone numbers are not listed in the phone directory. So none of the people selected from the phone directory will have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): The one man who stayed dry was not out in the rain with the others because he was in a coffin and the other four were at his funeral. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack and Tom were the parents themselves, there would be less than 4 people to divide the money among. But Jack and Tom are two different people and they have their own parents. Hence this makes them four different people. Each one gets $10. The answer is 2.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is tricky because it assumes that white sheep eat more than black sheep, which is not necessarily true. However, if we have to pick one answer, the number of white sheep in the world is higher than black sheep. So, in total, white sheep do eat more food but not because a single one individually eats more than a black sheep. The answer is 0

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being at a zoo provides a safe environment to see bears, therefore the woman wasn't afraid. So, the answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. "Before" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. Therefore, this is the reason why Tom lost the wager. The answer is 1.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement that resulted in Tom losing the bet was "John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game". The fact that John said the score would be 0-0 "before" any basketball game starts, therefore, he was right and won the bet. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The captain of the sports team would lead the team if an essential assistant captain resigns. The answer is 0

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can subtract 10 from 100 only once. After the first subtraction, you are subtracting from 90, not 100. So, the answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The simplest explanation is that all of the sheep are white. Half of 11 is 5.5, and you can't have half a sheep. But if all the sheep are white, then technically half of them are also white. The answer is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The officer says "I don't have a brother anymore", however James also didn't have a brother. The simplest explanation that doesn't require any additional information or interpretation could be that the officer was James' sister. Hence, The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If there are nine children and males make up half of them, it means all children are boys. It's a riddle - "males" refers to men, which make up half of the term "males", hence all the children are boys. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The boys are not twins but triplets, quadruplets, etc., which means another sibling (or siblings) is also likely to have been born on the same day. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question asks why the third man's feet remain dry despite not wearing boots. Walking on stilts or his hands would keep his feet above the ground and therefore dry. However, if the ground is not wet, his feet would stay dry even without boots. The most logical answer is 0.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. So, John's prediction was correct. The answer is 0

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): The only male in the room was presumably the mailman, as the doctor and lawyer were specified to be females. The officer figured that "John" was the mail man because of this. The answer is 0

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is about the duration of the stops. If a stop is being made every half an hour five times, the stops themselves add no duration to the total time as the question doesn't specify how long each stop lasts. Therefore, none of the choices provided is a correct answer. The answer is 3.

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fish tank was like a ring, which means that even if the fishes are swimming in opposite directions, they will be able to see each other every few minutes as they circle around the tank. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): There are less black sheep than white sheep. It's the number of sheep that is being referred to in the question and not the amount each sheep eat. So the answer is 2

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the girls were not identical twins, yet they looked the same, shared the same birthday, and were related, then it is possible that they were triplets or part of a larger multiple birth scenario where not all siblings have the same appearance. So, they could have another sibling making them a part of triplets or more. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The details provided do not indicate that the ground is not wet or that the man is walking on his hands or stilts. The third man can have dry feet despite not wearing rubber boots in an alternative scenario such as if he is being carried or if he is not walking directly on the ground. However, none of these possibilities is listed among the choices, so the correct answer is 3.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog can't be the father when thin because the question clearly states it's not the father. The fat dog eating all the food has no correlation with it being the father or not. The most logical choice is "The fat dog is the mother." The answer is 1

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards were looking in opposite directions, but they were not back to back. As they were facing each other, one could find out his partner was smiling. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. Christmas Day is on December 25th and New Year's Day is on January 1st of the following year, but they are both part of the same calendar year. The answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question seems to be based on the name of the location rather than the properties of the stone. "Yellowstone" is a name, not a description of the stone's color or other properties. Therefore, we can't determine the color. The answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lion being tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long would prevent him from reaching a human that is 7m away, unless the other end of what the lion is tethered to is not tied to anything. Then the lion would be free to move the full length of the piece of metal. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even though all these animals and you are in the room, they are all on the bed and you are on the bed too, not on the ground. So, none of their legs are on the ground. Traditional beds have four legs so the only legs that should be on the ground are the bed's. The answer is 1

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman actually fell inside her apartment, not outside, thus the fall was not a deadly 20-story drop but rather a harmless fall inside her apartment. The fireman's distance could not have made it possible for her to be caught. The answer is 1.

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man in the story could be reading in the daytime or could be blind and reading braille. Both options fit the premises of the story - no lights on at night, no other source of light, yet reading a book happily. Hence the answer can be either 0 or 2.

Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. The answer that makes the most logical sense is that it was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen. The answer is 1

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The math teacher can understand the test because math is a universal language and numbers are the same in French as they are in English. Even if Sally's other teachers had experience using a translator or had French friends, they would not be able to understand the test if they did not speak French themselves. The answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests.

There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The story mentions that the man was reading his book at night without any artificial light source. Even without artificial light, a man can read a book if it is in Braille, as this doesn't require sight but touch. So the man can be blind and read a book with braille. The answer is 1.

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): The most logical choice is that the station wasn't fixed in the marina. This would allow the boat to move away from the marina and find itself in the middle of the ocean. The dolphins untie the knot or the wave pushes the boat along with the marina are very unlikely. The answer is 0.

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of these statements actually give plausible reasons why an egg thrown against a hard rock wall wouldn't break. The answer is 3

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea doesn't mean it will change color. Unlike the previous examples in the question, the Red Sea isn't literally red and would not dye the shirt. So the shirt will remain white. The answer is 1.

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction.

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The young man could not have been unharmed from falling off a 100-foot ladder without some kind of exceptional circumstance. The most plausible explanation is that the young man was only on the first step, which would not have resulted in a harmful fall. The answer is 1.

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question provides the information that Mary's father has five children and Mary is one of them. So, the fifth child's name is Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): The runner ran a total of 70 kilometers in 5 days. If each day he ran two kilometers more than the previous day, the number of kilometers would add up like this: x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 70. Solving this equation you get x = 14 kilometers. Thus, on the first day, the runner ran 14 kilometers. None of the choices matches with this, so the answer is 3

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fisherman caught three more fish each day than the day before, and he caught a total of 30 fish in 5 days, then he must have started with fewer than three fish because adding three fish each day for 5 days (3+6+9+12+15) equals 45, which is greater than 30. The valid choice is that the fisherman caught one fish on the first day. The answer is 1.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Tony's nephew can be Jack's son. Since Tony is not married, Tony's nephew would have to come from a sibling. The answer is 0.

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fact that the man rode back is irrelevant to the days. The man's horse's name could explain the anomaly in days. If the horse he rode was named Sunday, then he indeed left on Sunday and returned on Sunday. The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction.

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?

Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The most likely reason the student always boards at the first stop and exits at the second one is that his home, the first and second stations are positioned on a hill. This allows him to ride down easily on his scooter, regardless of the distance of the train stations. The answer is 1.

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A barber is capable of shaving multiple times a day and it's their job to shave other people, not necessarily themselves. So, even if they shave others three times a day, they can still grow their own beard. The answer is 1.

The Red Sea is just the name of a body of water, not a description of its color. The shirt will not become green or red, but it will still be a white shirt, just wet. So the correct answer is 2.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fisherman caught more fish each day than the previous day. We know that the total is 30 and there were 5 days in the tournament. If we assign variables for each day and they are increasing by three every day, we have d1 + (d1+3) + (d1+6) + (d1+9) + (d1+12) = 30. Solving this equation gives us that d1=1. So the fisherman caught one fish on the first day. The answer is 1.

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
