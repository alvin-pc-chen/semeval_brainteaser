Model Answer (Wrong): Water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit would be ice. Therefore, a steel ball could not pass through it at this temperature. However, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit the water is in liquid form and the ball can pass through it. The answer is 1.

Question 8: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads?
Model Answer (Wrong): The camels were facing each other the entire time. They were in opposite directions, but they could have also been nose-to-nose at the same time. They would therefore be able to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads. The answer is 2.

Question 9: In Jamaica, some kids can stand on the water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, water would be frozen and it is possible for kids to stand on ice. So, the answer is 2.

Question 10: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): At 20 degrees Fahrenheit, the water would be frozen and thus a steel ball cannot fall through ice. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A boy had just finished getting ready for his prom, shaving, applying cologne, and there would be an after-party. His parents had told him to be home for the next sunrise, but he arrived with a full-grown beard instead. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): In certain parts of Alaska, there's a phenomenon where the sun does not rise for more than a month, especially during winter. So, even though he was told to be home by the next sunrise, he could technically stay out for a while if it was during this period. The answer is 0.

Question 12: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The girls did not get wet possibly because it was not raining. So their sharing of the umbrella did not result in anyone getting wet. The answer is 1.

Question 14: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The beggar is a woman, so the man who died is her brother, but as the man didn't have any brothers so the answer is 2.

Question 15: There were two camels facing in different directions. One was facing directly East, and the other directly West. There was no reflection because they were in the desert. How do they manage to see one another without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around?
Model Answer (Wrong): The camels were facing in different directions - one East, and the other West. They were facing each other the entire time, so they could see each other despite being in opposite directions. The answer is 0.

Question 16: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on?
Model Answer (Wrong): George is inside the building cleaning the windows because the hoist is disabled. He can get out of the building by walking down the stairs. The answer is 0

Question 17: Although Dorothy has never stated suicide ideas, whenever she feels down or depressed, she makes plans to go to a very high location that she has frequented before. Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards. What is going on here, and why has she never been hurt or, worse still, killed as a result of her dangerous behavior, if she isn't suicidal?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Dorothy jumps from an enormous height, and experiences no injuries, it’s possible that she is skydiving. This means she's a skydiver. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 18: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain?
Model Answer (Wrong): A man who sleeps with a light as bright as the sun but doesn't bother his neighbors most likely lives in a lighthouse. The nature of a lighthouse is to have a very bright light. The answer is 2.

Question 19: I dig out tiny caves and store gold and silver in them. I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold. They are the smallest you could imagine. Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The answer is a dentist. Dentists make crowns for teeth out of gold and fill cavities with silver filings, which is referred to as 'tiny caves'. People need dentists for dental care but some are afraid due to fear of pain or discomfort. The answer is 1.

Question 20: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): He was on a bridge when he first saw the train, so he couldn't jump off the track immediately. He had to run towards the train to get off the bridge and only then could he jump off the track. The answer is 1.

Question 21: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored?
Model Answer (Wrong): George was cleaning the windows when the power failure occurred. If George was cleaning the inside of windows, he could walk down the stairs before the power was restored. So, the answer is 2.

Question 22: One evening, Joe and Sally were relaxing in their family room. Sally, Joe's wife, was reading while he was watching television. The moment the electricity went out, Joe made the decision to retire to bed, but Sally continued to read. Sally carried on reading without using any artificial lighting. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The electricity went out, but Sally was still able to read. If it were daytime, there would be no need for electricity to read. But as Joe and Sally relaxed in the evening, it's unlikely the natural light would be enough for reading. If Sally were blind, she could read a book using Braille. Sally's intelligence is not relevant in this context. The answer is 1

Question 23: A woman living in Rome legally gave birth to five children, but she has never been pregnant. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Surrogate mothers carry and give birth to children for those who can't conceive. However, if the woman has never been pregnant, she cannot be a surrogate. The answer that logically explains this situation is not among the choices provided. So, the answer is 3.

Question 24: A woman shoots publicly at people at a National Park. The park is full of people, but no one gets killed. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman was shooting with a camera, not a gun. This means she was a photographer, hence no one got killed. The answer is 0.

Question 25: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, this means she has at least one pet which isn't a dog. If all but one are cats, this means she also has at least one pet that isn't a cat. If Mrs. Smith only has two pets, this implies she has one dog and one cat. So, the correct answer is 2.

Question 26: A woman is found dead in a field of snow. The only tracks are her own leading up to her. There are no signs of struggle, no other footprints, and no other evidence. Only an abandoned pack of balloons is found nearby. How did she die?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lady could not have died of a heart attack, since there is no evidence supporting it. Likewise, there is no evidence to suggest that the lady killed herself using a toxic substance in a balloon. However, a hot air balloon losing altitude could have led to her death. The abandoned pack of balloons could be from the hot air balloon. When the ballon was losing altitude, she may have thrown them out to lighten the balloon, but it did not work and she died in the crash. The answer is 0.

Question 27: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): "Lightning" could be a nickname referring to his speed if he's a professional sprinter. This reason would also explain why he is pleased when people call him "Lightning." The answer is 0.

Question 28: I break down walls and devour towers. I consume iron and corrode steel, but still, I am essential to all. Sometimes, people desire me, yet they fear my uncontrolled presence. What am I?
Model Answer (Wrong): Oxygen breaks down walls and devours towers through the process of oxidation, which is what happens when iron rusts and steel corrodes. Oxygen is essential to all life on Earth, and while people need it to live, an uncontrolled presence of it can lead to fires or other problems. The answer is 0

Question 29: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): That the rope is not tied to anything else is the simplest choice. The horse can reach the hay whenever he chooses. The answer is 1

Question 30: Two lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island, one faces due North and the other due South. They never turn or rotate. How can they both illuminate the same ship at the same time?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lighthouses face opposite directions and do not rotate. The only possible way for both of them to illuminate the same ship at the same time is if the ship is not on water but in the sky i.e., it is a spaceship. The answer is 0

Question 31: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily?
Model Answer (Wrong): Emily would need to enter a place where she can see the time. Among the options, only a clock store is likely to have this information readily available. The answer is 2.

Question 32: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pilot's airplane is named Tuesday. No matter how the airplane flies or how long it flies, it is still Tuesday. The answer is 0.

Question 33: A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man put his hat away and donned a blindfold. His vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. He did not use a computer to compute his actions or the sound to feel the direction. If he hung his hat on the barrel of his gun, even with the blindfold, he could shoot the hat. The answer is 0

Question 34: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive?
Model Answer (Wrong): Lions cannot survive without food for 5 years. So, if the lions haven't eaten in 5 years, they would have died. The answer is 2

Question 35: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this?
Model Answer (Wrong): The sharpshooter could not use sound to determine direction, a computer would not help him see, and a blindfold would block his vision. However, if he hung his hat on the barrel of his gun, he would know exactly where his hat was when he turned around to shoot, even if he couldn't see it. The answer is 1.

Question 36: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fact that she has never been injured from jumping from great heights and feels much better afterward suggests that Dorothy is a skydiver or a bungee jumper rather than suicidal. Skydiving or bungee jumping can be very therapeutic for some people. The answer is 2.

Question 37: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man did not literally kill 365 people. In this context, 'killed' is a metaphor. If he lives in a lighthouse, his job would be to keep the lights on to prevent ships from crashing into the coast. By deciding to sleep rather than keeping the lights on, he indirectly caused the death of 365 people on a ship that crashed because there was no light to guide them. The answer is 0

Question 38: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Craig and Tracy passed away but everyone was ecstatic. This could be because they were both hurricanes. When hurricanes dissipate, people are often relieved because they no longer pose a threat. The answer is 0

Question 39: Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): There are six daughters, all of whom share the same one brother. This means there are seven children in total. Add in the two parents, Mr. and Mrs. Mustard, and the family is made up of nine people. So, the answer is 1.

Question 40: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman does not commit murder. In this context, "shooting" someone means taking their photo, "holding him underwater" refers to the development process in photography, and "hanging him" refers to hanging the photo up to dry. The answer is 2.

Question 41: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was on a bridge when he first saw the train, he wouldn't be able to jump off the track right away. He can only do so once he's not on the bridge. The answer is 2

Question 42: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion?
Model Answer (Wrong): Given the circumstances, it's plausible that she could deflate her kayak slightly to pass through the narrow part of the river. The other options either don't solve the problem or wouldn't be practical in her predicament. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 43: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question clearly states that the pilot did this without any technological assistance or help from others, and with his vision completely obscured. So, he cannot receive technological assistance stealthy or use the sound to feel the direction. Attaching the ring to the front of his plane before putting on the blindfold is a plausible response, as this would allow him to fly through the ring without seeing. The answer is 2.

Question 44: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman might have been on a cliff edge when she saw the bear, and couldn't immediately step off the path. The most logical answer here is not that she was trying to trick her own brain or minimize risk, so the answer is 0.

Question 45: Emma was making a peach cobbler. After peeling and chopping all the peaches, she realized that she had to add a teaspoon of cinnamon for every four peaches. How did she figure out how much cinnamon to add?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Emma peeled and chopped all the peaches, the pits would be left. By counting the pits, she would know how many peaches she used and could calculate how much cinnamon to add. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, "That boy is my son." Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man at the baseball game is the boy's father. The coach, who is also claiming to be the boy's parent, can be the boy's mother. Thus, the answer is 0.

Question 47: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The doctor is the mother of the son. This makes it possible for the doctor to be the parent of the son needing surgery, despite the deceased father. The answer is 1.

Question 48: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Each daughter shares the same brother, so there are six daughters, one brother, and the two parents. Totaling nine people. The answer is 2.

Question 49: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The drinks that they ordered could have had ice in them. After drinking, the leftover ice in Juliana's glasses could have melted into water, thus refilling a portion of the those glasses. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 50: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): A dentist fills cavities (little caves) and creates bridges and crowns. Everyone needs dental work at some point in their life. The answer is 0.

Question 51: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The rope doesn't need to be extended, nor does the saloon's structure need to be altered for the horse to reach the hay. The horse can eat the hay because the rope isn't tied to anything else, allowing the horse to roam freely. The answer is 1.

Question 52: A couple is having a disagreement over the man's error. The man kept apologizing and pleading with the woman to allow him to see her directly. The woman was still upset. Thus, she wouldn't agree. The couple, though, was positioned on the same mat. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The couple is positioned on the same mat. It is possible the woman is turning her back on the man. This way, even if they are on the same mat, he can't see her directly. The answer is 1

Question 53: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The farmer claimed that he harvested the radishes from his own farm that morning but there was no dew on the radishes. Dew would have been present on radishes harvested that morning. The answer is 1

Question 54: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill?
Model Answer (Wrong): The name of the third person in the group is "Wednesday," not the day of the week. Wednesday paid the bill. The answer is 2

Question 55: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl.
Model Answer (Wrong): Bats are known for their ability to navigate and find food in complete darkness. They use echolocation, a process of emitting sounds and listening to the echoes to determine the location and distance of objects. So, among the choices, a bat would see most clearly in total darkness. The answer is 2.

Question 56: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water?

Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself?
Model Answer (Wrong): The story suggests that every time Matthew takes a dive, he feels better, which implies that he might be diving into water, not putting himself in danger. So, Matthew could be a deep-sea diver. The answer is 0.

Question 59: How could a cowboy ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday?
Model Answer (Wrong): The cowboy rode into town on Friday, stayed two days, and rode out on Wednesday. This could only occur if his horse was named Friday, not that Friday and Saturday are holidays or he stayed in bed for two days. So, the answer is 1.

Question 60: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden.

Question 74: Even in the harshest of droughts, a man living in New York City would never drink from the Mississippi River. Why not?
Model Answer (Wrong): The Mississippi River does not flow through New York City, which is likely why a man living there would not drink from it. So, the answer is 1.

Question 75: A woman went to visit her bank manager and she took her young daughter with her. The bank manager said that the woman's daughter could stay with his secretary during the meeting. When the woman and her daughter left, the secretary turned to the other secretary and said to her, "That little girl was my daughter." How could that be?

Model Answer (Wrong): Both Maria and Juliana had the same drink, but Maria was the only one who died. If the poison took time to dissolve, both of them should have still been affected. It was also likely that Juliana would have been more affected since she drank more. Similarly, if the poison was unfunctional when drunk together, both women should have survived. If the poison was in the ice, Maria who drank slowly would have given the ice more time to melt and therefore consumed more poison. The answer is 2.

Question 82: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?

The answer is 2.

Question 91: Brad started through the dirty sort-shared window on the 22nd floor of the office tower. Overcome with depression he slid the window open and jumped through it. It was a sheer drop outside the building to the ground. Miraculously after he landed he was completely uninjured. Since there was nothing to cushion his fall or slow his descent, how could he have survived the fall?
Model Answer (Wrong): Brad wouldn't have survived an unaided fall from the 22nd floor. It doesn't matter if the ground was wet or if Brad is bodybuilder. The physics won't allow it. However, from the given choices, Brad was a window washer so theoretically he jumped inside the building, not outside. The answer is 1.

Question 92: Wednesday,Tom and Joe went to a restaurant and ate dinner. When they were done they paid and left. Tom and Joe didn't pay. Who did?
Model Answer (Wrong): The logical entailment here is the name misdirection.

Thus, it was Wednesday who paid for the dinner and not Tom and Joe. The answer is 0.

A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest?
Model Answer (Wrong): Danny could easily get the semi out from under the bridge by letting some air out of his tires. This will lower the semi enough for it to come out of the overpass. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The most logical choice is 0. If there are five players and each player has one coach, and the total number of people in the team is six, then the players must share the same coach. This would mean that there is one coach who trains all five players. The answer is 0.

Model Answer (Wrong): Morgan wouldn't need to know if she was excellent at being a chef or if she was good at physics to measure the amount of lemon juice. She needs to count apricots to know how much lemon juice to add. One method to estimate the count of apricots is to count the pits. The answer is 2.

Question 107: Friday, Jason and Kobe go to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter gave three sets of knives and forks to their table. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The names mentioned are Friday, Jason, and Kobe. Assuming "Friday" is a person, there are indeed three people, which corresponds to the three sets of knives and forks. The answer is 1

Question 108: Four people sat down to play a board game. They played four rounds and each person won twice. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If each person won twice, it's logical to assume they were playing in pairs or teams (thus creating the possibility of each person being a part of two victories). Hence, the correct answer is 0.

Question 109: A man who resided on the twenty-story building's top floor had to travel up and down each day for work, as well as for food and other requirements.
