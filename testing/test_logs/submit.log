Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer. The lazy farmer, however, is not his father. This is possible if the lazy farmer is his mother. Thus, the answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Romeo and Juliet can be names of fish. If a train khocked their tank off the shelf, the tank could have broken, and Romeo and Juliet would not survive outside of the water. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): This would happen every year. If today is the day before your birthday, then tomorrow, your birthday, you will be one year older than you are today. The answer is 2.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards were facing each other. That's why they could see each other's faces. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): A house cannot jump, so even if the dog doesn't jump high, it jumps higher than a house by default. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): 100 divided by 10 equals 10. After the first division, it's no longer 100. So you can divide 100 by 10 once. The answer is 1

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide enough information to determine how many additional criminals the police can find. The answer is 3.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. New Year's Day is at the start of the year and Christmas is later in the same year. The answer is 1

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs. So regardless of how well the farmer fed them, they would not be able to produce eggs. The answer is 1.

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question doesn't provide information on whether the playground was strictly for football or Mark's personal preferences. But it does provide the information that someone's appearance in the playground caused excitement. If Mark wasn't a fan of football or the playground wasn't only for football, he wouldn't necessarily approach the footballer. But it doesn't specify how Mark knew who the person was that people got excited for. Therefore, none of the choices given directly offer a definitive and logical explanation for how Mark could know. The answer is 3

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is asking why only one man stayed dry while the rest got wet in the rain. Being an athlete wouldn't prevent him from getting wet, and luck wouldn't keep him dry in the rain. But if he "stayed" because he was in a coffin, he would not get wet because he is undercover, provided context implies the other men are at his funeral. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): She was not necessarily afraid of the bear because she was at the zoo. Being in a zoo setting, she would be safe from the bear because of enclosures or barriers designed to separate animals from visitors. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man did not need to be a jumping athlete to win the bet, and the height of one house in relation to the other is not a logical explanation for how he could jump from one to the other. However, if the houses were right next to each other, he could jump the distance. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant testified that the attorney is her brother, and the attorney confirmed that he did not have a brother. This could be possible if the accountant was the attorney's sister. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant is the attorney's sister, this is how she can say 'the attorney is my brother' and the attorney can claim he has no brother. The answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The group consists of a grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter. This means there are two mothers and two daughters in total, but only three individuals. Each person gets $7. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): All of the children are boys, so 'half' are boys is technically correct as well. The answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): Taking one medication every half hour would take an hour and a half. The answer is 0

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Houses can't jump. The question hinges on the fact that the house can't jump at all, so any height the dog jumps is higher than the house. The answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the student forgot to bring their rubber boots, their feet might still be dry if the ground wasn't wet. Neither walking on hands nor on stilts is a logical or practical option in this case. The answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs, so the egg could not have been laid by the rooster. The answer is 1

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If James was surrounded by several hungry bears but they just looked at him and then left, it is likely because he was at a zoo, where the bears couldn't actually reach him. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill right away, the second one half an hour later, and the last one half an hour after that. Therefore, it would take one hour for you to consume all the pills. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): The correct answer is once because once you subtract 10 from 100 it's no longer 100. The answer is 0

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The answer is 0. They were triplets. This means that there was a third child, so although the two girls who were questioned do have a sibling with the same birth date, they are not twins.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Nothing human-related would have caused Romeo and Juliet's death given the facts provided. The explanation that makes the most sense is that Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train passing by could have made the tank on the shelf tumble and break, resulting in their death. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The coach is supposed to lead the team in case the vice coach is unable to attend a game. Hence, the answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fact that the mailman was the only man present would have caught the cop's attention. The doctor and lawyer were both female, so the 'John' that was mentioned would most likely refer to the mailman. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): The premise of this question is not necessarily correct. Consumption depends on various factors and not just age. Therefore, saying older people eat more than younger people is a generalization that doesn't always apply. So, the answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack is a fish. If a sudden wave knocks a fish out of water, it would not be able to breathe and would die. The answer is 2

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog, despite not being the thin dog's father, could be the thin dog's mother and is the parent of the small dog. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are males and do not lay eggs. Therefore, it is impossible for it to have laid an egg. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not inform that he avoided the rain. It was not mentioned that he was a football player or a photographer, or that he was lucky. None of these assumptions are supported by the information in the question. The question is invalid. The answer is 3.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): They are one daughter, one mother and one grandmother. The daughter is also considered a mother which technically means there's only three people. Therefore, they're able to split the $21 equally. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the above. Unlisted phone numbers are not included in the phone directory. So if we select names from the phone directory, none of them will have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man who stayed dry during the rain was actually in a coffin and the other four were his funeral attendees. They got wet while he did not because he was inside the coffin. Thus, the answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, the two of them could have split the $40 equally. This would mean that each person got $20. The answer is 0.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of the sheep doesn't inherently affect how much it consumes. The food consumption of a sheep depends on other factors, such as its size, age, and overall health, rather than its color. This statement seems to indicate a larger number of white sheep than black. The answer is 0

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the woman was at the zoo, the bear would be in a contained space and would not pose a direct threat to her. This would explain why she ran toward it excitedly and without fear. The answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement specifies that John has predicted the outcome of the football game, and that Tom has lost the wager, so the most logical reason is that John's prediction was correct. But the prediction being 0-0 at the beginning isn't a prediction of the "outcome" of the game, it's the score at the very start of the game. Therefore, none of the choices really explain why Tom would have lost the bet. The answer is 3.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game is the only reason given for Tom losing the bet. The only reason applicable by logic is that the score before any basketball game starts is always 0-0 so the outcome can be accurately predicted. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The captain of the team would lead the team, even if the assistant captain resigned. The answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can technically subtract 10 from 100 only once. After the first subtraction, the number you are subtracting from is no longer 100. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the farmer has 11 sheep and half of them are white, that means all of them are white because we can't have half of one sheep. The answer is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The officer said she doesn't have a brother anymore, but this doesn't necessarily mean she had a brother to start. The statement makes sense if the officer is James's sister. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all nine children are males, then males make up half of them, and more than half. Therefore, the answer is 2. They are all boys.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The only possible answer here is that they are triplets. They live in the same house, have the same parents, and share the same birthday, but they are not twins, meaning there must be at least one or more siblings identical to them. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The ground is not wet. If it was wet, the third man's feet would have gotten wet without boots. It doesn't mention anywhere about the third man walking on stilts or his hands. The answer is 0

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. The answer is 0.

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): All the professions were mentioned but there was no occupation mentioned for John. Since there were only three people in the room and all of them had their professions disclosed except for the mail man, the cop deduced that John was the mail man. The answer is 0.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The driver stops every half an hour five times, but the time of actual stops is not given. The question is missing necessary information. The answer is 3.

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fishes were in a ring-shaped fish tank, they would be able to swim in opposite directions and still see each other every couple of minutes. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of sheep in the world and their color has nothing to do with how much they eat individually. The color of the sheep does not affect their appetite. The answer is 2 because there are less black sheep in the world than white.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The girls had the same appearance and shared the same birthday. They were honest when they said they were not identical twins, because they were triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the third man's feet are dry, and he isn't wearing boots, he must be avoiding the wet ground in some way. Walking on stilts or his hands could keep his feet dry. However, if he were walking on his hands, his hands would get just as wet as his feet would. The only logical choice is that he is walking on stilts. The answer is 1.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog isn't the father of the thin dog, as the fat dog is the mother - being a female dog - and mother to the thin dog. The answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year, as Christmas Day is on December 25 and New Year's Day is on January 1 of the following calendar year. Therefore the answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): Yellowstone is the name of a national park, not a color. The question is a play on words. Thus, none of the provided choices are accurate. The answer is 3

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The other end of the metal is not tied to anything, so the Lion can go where it wants. The answer is 1

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): You are the only one on the ground because you're the only one who entered the room; the rest are on the bed or flapping above it. So, only your two legs are on the ground. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the woman fell from the balcony there would be nothing to stop her fall other than the net, which the fireman was not holding. The only logical explanation, is that the woman did not jump off the balcony, but fell back into her apartment. The answer is 1.

There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man could be reading in the daytime when no artificial light is needed, or the man could be blind and is using braille to read. Both 0 and 2 are valid answers in this case.

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland.

Model Answer (Wrong): The man couldn't have ridden back into town real-time on Sunday if he left on Friday. However, if his horse were named "Sunday," this would explain why he "rode back on Sunday" two hours after leaving town, regardless of the actual day. The answer is 0.

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the provided choices logically answers the question. The logical answer would be something like "the glass ball was filled with a soft material to cushion the impact," but this option is not provided. The answer is 3

There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man could not read in a completely dark room with no light sources, even if he is smart. Being blind also would not allow him to read a visual book in the dark. If it was daytime, there would be natural light, and he could read his book. This is the most logical conclusion. The answer is 2.

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the station to which the boat was tied was not fixed, then the boat could drift away. Dolphins wouldn't likely untie the knots, and powerful waves wouldn't move the marina, they would cause damage instead. The answer is 0

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The raw egg will not crack if you don't throw it at all. Therefore, none of the given options provide a solution to the situation. The answer is 3

Model Answer (Wrong): The clue here is "you don't see a single person on the boat". This could mean that everyone on the boat is in a relationship, so there's no "single" person. So the answer is 2.

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea doesn't change its color, such as what would happen if you threw it into a red dye. The Red Sea's name doesn't denote its color.
