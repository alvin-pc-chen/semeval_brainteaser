System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: The ship was in the harbor on a beautiful sunny day. The ship suddenly started to sink. The ship sank in front of the onlookers despite there being no storm or mechanical issue. What led to the ship's sinking?
                Choices: 0 = There are too many fish around the ship.; 1 = There are too many spectators in the harbor.; 2 = It was a Submarine.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The fish would not impact the ship's sinking. There was no mechanical issue, which means that the ship was supposed to sink such as a submarine. The answer is 2
                Question: Natives of the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg, not even if they are starving. Exactly why not?
                Choices: 0 = Penguins only live in Antarctica.; 1 = Penguins' eggs are toxic.; 2 = Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.; 3 = None of above.;
                Reponse: Penguins' eggs are not toxic and there is no evidence given for the native cultural diet. Penguins only live in Antarctica, so the natives of the Arctic would never eat a penguin's egg. The answer is 0
                Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?
                Choices: 0 = Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.; 1 = The ground outside the building is wet.; 2 = Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even very strong men would not survive a fall from a 22-story building. The ground outside the building being wet would not cushion his fall. Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside. The answer is 0
                Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend?
                Choices: 0 = He told Danny to left the bridge.; 1 = He told Danny to overturn the track.; 2 = He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The bridge would not be lifted. Overturning the truck would not help. Letting some air out of his tires would help. The answer is 2
                Question: Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?
                Choices: 0 = Old money weight more than new money.; 1 = Old money is dirtier than new money.; 2 = Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: 1968 and 1967 refer to the number of pennies not that some are older and some are newer. The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies. The answer is 2
                Question: You are a bus driver. Mrs. Smith, an elderly woman, and Raymond, a small child, are on the bus when you start your journey. The elderly woman exits at the first stop, and Ed, a salesperson, enters. At the following stop, three women carrying shopping bags board the bus along with Jack and his sister Jill. After fifteen minutes of riding, the bus stops, Raymond gets off, and a guy and his wife board. A woman then boards the bus while carrying a caged bird. Who is the bus driver?
                Choices: 0 = Jil.; 1 = Mrs. Smith; 2 = Raymond.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The bus driver is you, all the other people are passengers. The answer is 3
                Question: Despite being in December, David's birthday is never in the winter. Why?
                Choices: 0 = His family will hold a huge celebration for him.; 1 = He lives in Australia.; 2 = He alwasy gets cold in winter.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: David's family holding a huge celebration or that he gets cold in winter has nothing to do with his birthday being in winter. David's birthday is never in the winter because he lives in Australia. The answer is 1
                Question: There was no power in town, and none of the street lights or traffic signals worked. A dark limousine sped down the recently laid blacktop, headlights turned off. A little youngster in complete black (no reflectors) went out to cross the roadway. Despite the fact that the moon was not out and the youngster had no flashlight, the motorist stopped to let the boy to cross the street. How did the driver notice the youngster?
                Choices: 0 = The driver was good at listening.; 1 = The driver was paying much attention on the road.; 2 = The driver saw the boy because it was during the daylight hours.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The driver could not have paid enough attention or heard the youngster in time if it were dark outside. The driver must have seen the boy, and all lights were off because it was during daylight hours. The answer is 2


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lazy farmer could not be characterized as irresponsible or forgotten by the diligent farmer based on the information provided. The lazy farmer is not the father of the diligent farmer. This means that the lazy farmer is his mother. The answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The sound from the track or the shaking of the shelf crushing them does not explain the presence of glass and water on the floor. Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke, and Romeo and Juliet did not survive. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): This event does not have to do with leap years or graduation. Before your birthday, you are one year younger than you will be tomorrow. This happens every year. The answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sporting organization, the captain would continue to serve as the team's captain if an assistant captain departed, as their roles are distinct and separate. The departure of an assistant captain does not directly affect the position of the captain. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you are picking from the city's phone directory, people with unlisted numbers won't be included in the directory. Therefore, none of the 100 people you choose at random will have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The possibility of the guard having unusual vision or the smiling guard's action being so big is unlikely. The guards knew each other was smiling because although they were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back and were facing each other. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The species of the dog and the height of the house are not mentioned in the question. The bet was that the dog could jump higher than a house, and as the house cannot jump, the man won. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can divide 100 by 10 once to get 10. Dividing it further would not yield 10 anymore. Thus, the answer is 1.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The police would be able to find the criminals listed in their prisons namebook, which is 200 people. Looking for the "rest wandering in the city" without names would be a challenge, and the question does not provide evidence that additional criminals would be found. So, the police can find 200 people. The answer is 2.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year every year because New Year's Day is on January 1st and Christmas is on December 25th of the same year. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The neighbor stealing eggs or roosters eating their own eggs is not relevant. The reason no eggs were produced is because roosters don't lay eggs. The answer is 1.

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): There is no mention that the playground was specific to any sport or that Mark was only a fan of football. His proximity to the football player is also not mentioned. The question does not have any logical conclusions within the given answer choices. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): Whether the man is an athlete or lucky has no bearing on whether he gets wet in the rain. The man stayed completely dry because he was in a coffin, the four other men were at his funeral. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman becoming suddenly brave or trying to scare the bear doesn't provide a logical reason for her lack of fear. The woman was at the zoo; that would explain why she wasn't afraid of the bear. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man's athleticism or the relative heights of the houses would not affect his ability to jump between them. The houses must have been wall-to-wall next to each other to make this possible. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The attorney not being loved by family and having moved away when he was young or being angry about his brother not being an attorney does not change the fact that he has a brother. The accountant is his sister. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The attorney being angry about his brother not being an attorney or that he was not loved by the family and had moved away doesn't explain not having a brother. The answer is the accountant was his sister. Hence, the answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): One mother giving money to her son and two daughters sharing money does not explain how they evenly distribute the money among each other. The three people are a grandmother, a mother and a daughter. This means the mother is also a daughter and the grandmother is also a mother. Therefore, they are two mothers and two daughters. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man raising his children in both boy and girl way or one child being regarded as both boy and girl at the same time does not impact the actual sex of the children. It is possible that all of the man's children are boys. The answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first medicine right away, the second one half an hour later, and the third one another half an hour later. So, all the medicine would keep you going for an hour. The answer is 2

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The dog species or the height of the house would not cause the dog to jump higher than the house. A house can not jump. So, technically, the dog can jump higher than the house. The answer is 0

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): The student might not be walking on his hands or stilts during the trek. The most plausible explanation for his feet remaining dry is if the ground is not wet. The answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs, so the egg could not have rolled on that side. The answer is 1.

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The cold weather or James's health wouldn't have deterred the bears. Thus, James must have been in the zoo. The bears could not reach him. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill right away, the second one half an hour later, and the last one after another half hour. So the pills last one hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): After you subtract 10 from 100 once, you no longer have 100. So you can only subtract 10 from 100 once. The answer is 0.

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): Their parents raising them differently due to a lack of money or one of the girls not being loved by their family would not change the fact that they were born on the same day and look exactly alike. They were not twins but triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Romeo and Juliet being scared by the sound of a track would not cause their death. The shelf crushing them is not supported by the evidence provided. Romeo and Juliet were fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke, and they did not survive. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The vice coach is a substitute for the coach. If the vice coach is unable to be at a game, the coach would take over. The answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The policeman having information about the dead man's relatives or the names of doctors and lawyers is not provided. The mail man was the only man present, so he must be the "John" the person was referring to. The answer is 2

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): Older people living longer is not related to the food consumption of older people compared to younger people. The statement lacks information to support that older adults may have specific dietary requirements to address age-related issues, or to confirm older people require increased nutrient intake to support overall health and well-being. The answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack's fear of water wouldn't cause death. The need to go to the hospital also does not logically entail his death in this scenario. If Jack is a fish, being knocked out of the water and unable to return would cause his death in five minutes. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The size or behaviors of the dogs does not determine their relationships. The fat dog must be the mother if it is not the father. The answer is 2

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters can't lay eggs. Only hens (female chickens) can. It's not about where the egg would roll or there being a hole in the roof. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being an excellent football player or lucky does not aid in avoiding rain. The man was a photograph, the other people were there to honor a former player clearly lacks context. The answer is 3

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): One mother giving $7 to her son or two daughters sharing the $7 does not provide an accurate division among two mothers and two daughters. However, the scenario is possible if "they" refers to one daughter (who is also a mother), one mother (who is also a grandmother), and one grandmother. Each would then receive $7, satisfying the equal division. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): The unlisted phone numbers would not be in the phone directory. So, no person selected from the directory would have an unlisted phone number. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man being lucky to avoid the rain or being an athlete that can avoid rain at high speed is not plausible given the scenario. The one man was in a coffin, and the other men were at his funeral, so he didn't get wet. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack and Tom sharing the same parents doesn't specify how the money is divided equally. Each kid's parents pooling $10 for division doesn't explain how the money was divided amongst four people. Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, means that there are only two people involved in the division. The answer is 0.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of black sheep in the world has nothing to do with an individual sheep's food consumption. Black sheep do need food, so that option is not valid. Black absorbing more heat from sunlight and potential body temperature regulation is not mentioned or implied. The most logical answer is that there are more white sheep than black and therefore they consume more food overall. The answer is 0.

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): Rather than being brave or trying to scare the bear, the woman was at the zoo. She would not scare the bear while at the zoo because she is not in direct contact with it and knows she is safe. The answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): There is no evidence of John possessing an extraordinary ability to see into the future or Tom showing kindness by giving away their money. By saying the score would be 0-0 before any game starts, John was correct. The answer is 1

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John does not necessarily have to see into the future to predict a score like that and Tom giving his money out of kindness does not indicate a lost bet. However, the score is 0-0 before any basketball game starts, thus John's prediction was accurate. The answer is 0

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The essential assistant captain doesn't lead the team, the captain does. So if the assistant captain resigns, the captain will still lead the team. The answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): After you subtract 10 from 100 once, the number is no longer 100. Therefore, you can only subtract 10 from 100 once. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If half of his sheep are white, all sheep must be white to fulfill this. The answer is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The officer being angry or not being loved by his family would not change the statement about not having a brother. The officer arrested James and said, "I don't have a brother anymore," but James also didn't have a brother. This statement makes sense if the officer was actually his sister. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The children cannot be both boys and girls at the same time, and raising his children both ways does not change their gender. If males make up half of nine kids, the only possible explanation is that all children are boys. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): One of the boys being unloved or their upbringing would have no bearing on whether they are twins. The boys could respond truthfully to both being born on the same date and not being twins because they are triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The ground being wet or not is not mentioned, and there's no information about the third man walking on his hands. The third man's feet remain dry because he's walking on stilts, elevating his feet above the wet ground. The answer is 1.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John does not need to be able to see into the future and there is no evidence that Tom gave his money to John out of kindness. Before the game starts, the score is always 0-0. So, Tom lost the bet because John said the score would be 0-0. The answer is 0

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): There is no evidence that John can't be a doctor or a lawyer. The dead man's relationship with the doctor and lawyer is not known. The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that "John" was the mail man. The answer is 0.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The stops don't happen every half an hour, they happen for five times every half hour. This means the total time for stops is 2 and a half hours. The answer is 1

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The water in the tank reflecting or the fish having an unusual vision are not likely. The fish tank was likely circular or ring-like, hence why the fish saw each other every few minutes despite swimming in opposite directions. The answer is 1

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): Black sheep do need food, and their color does not significantly change their appetite because of body temperature regulation. The reason black sheep eat less than white sheep is because there are less black sheep in the world than white. The answer is 2

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Their parents raising them differently or one girl not being loved by the family wouldn't affect whether or not they're twins. The girls could share the same appearance and birthday and not be twins if they were triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The ground is lush and muddy, so the third man's feet should be wet. The third man is not walking on his hands, this would imply that his hands would be dirty. The answer that is most logical is that by walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground. The answer is 1.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog cannot be the father when it was thin since the relationship between the fat dog and the thin dog was already mentioned. The fat dog being a responsible father or not has nothing to do with the fat dog being the father of the thin dog. The fat dog is the mother. The answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards could not see each other if they were looking in opposite directions and were back to back. The action of smiling wouldn't be so big that the other guard could see it if he were looking out. The guards must have been facing each other, so one saw the other smile. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year, as Christmas is on December 25th and New Year's Day is on January 1st of the following year. The answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of the shirt after being placed on a stone would depend on the color of the stone if it were wet. The color of Yellowstone does not provide information about a specific color of a stone. The answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The rope stretching proportionally is not a possible solution because ropes do not typically stretch that much. The lion cannot dig a tunnel to reach the human. The only logical choice left is that the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, allowing the lion to move freely despite being tied to a piece of metal. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of animals on the bed or flying above it would not add to the count of legs on the ground. The four legs of the bed plus your own two make six legs on the ground. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the woman is strong, a fall from a 20-story building would cause severe injuries. The fireman was too far away to reach the woman in time. The woman must have fallen back into the apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. The answer is 1.

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman does not generally have a beard to maintain. A superstar shaving three times a day wouldn't necessarily maintain a beard. A barber shaves other people's beards multiple times a day and still keeps his own beard. The answer is 1.

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg gently or hard would crack the egg. The question is pertaining to the concrete floor not cracking, not the egg, therefore the answer is 'No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack'. The answer is 2

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jessica's story did not tell us whether or not the man was blind or smart. However, as there was no light source available for the man to read, he could have been reading braille. The answer is 2.

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of the tractor falling into the hail or floating on the lake does not explain how the tractor ended up on the island as a whole. It was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The history teacher having a friend from France or the English teacher using a translator does not mean they should understand French. The math teacher was most likely to understand the test because numbers are the same in every language. The answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Next week being a national holiday or the man being too exhausted to remember his way home doesn't explain him riding back on Sunday 2 hours after leaving on Friday. His horse was called Sunday, so he rode back on "Sunday". The answer is 0.

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a fragile glass ball hard or gently against a sturdy brick wall would shatter it. The brick being hard to crack doesn't prevent the glass ball from shattering. The answer is 3

Question 72: Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Lisa cannot be Emily's daughter because the question states that Lisa is not Emily's niece. Whether Emily is adopted or Emily and William share the same father but not the mother would not affect the relationship between Lisa and Emily. Lisa is William's niece and not Emily's niece because Lisa is Emily's daughter. The answer is 0.

Question 73: In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?
Model Answer (Wrong): The police wouldn't put out the fire at all, it would be the responsibility of fire fighters. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?
Model Answer (Wrong): The history teacher having a friend from France or the English teacher using a translator would not necessarily mean they could understand French. Sally's math test would still be understandable to the math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English. The answer is 2.

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): No amount of medical attention would prevent a man from getting hurt when jumping off a 50-story building. The height of the building for the man is irrelevant. The man didn't get hurt because he jumped off the ground floor, not from the top of the building. The answer is 1

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Whether the ladder is tall for the boy or not, it would still hurt falling from it and getting medical attention doesn't prevent the hurt. He did not get hurt because he was only on the first step. The answer is 2.

Question 77: You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The boats being used for storage of water or fruits have no relation to the absence of water for floating boats around them. The tide makes the boats float again and the issues get resolved at that time. The answer is 0.

Question 78: He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A businessman or a publisher might have been involved in the production of books, but they do not author them. The only possible answer is that he is a writer who does not physically write the words himself. The answer is 3.

Question 79: In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man were smart pretending to read the book, it doesn't clarify him actually reading. It's not necessarily day time, as the description implies it's night. The man is blind and is reading braille which does not require light. The answer is 1.

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): The dolphins untied the knots is not a plausible option. Waves being powerful would still not push the boat in middle of the ocean. The station being unsturdy and potentially moving from the marina could lead the boat into the ocean. The answer is 0.

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg gently or hard does not prevent it from breaking when hitting a hard rock wall. The statement does not say anything about concrete floors. None of the choices provide a valid reason for a raw egg not to break when thrown against a hard rock wall. The answer is 3.

Question 82: You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The people on the boat jumping into the sea would have been mentioned, as well the boat being big enough to hide everyone. The answer is that all people are in relationships: there is not a "single" person on the boat. The answer is 2.

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): The Red Sea won't turn the white shirt red, much like how painting a house changes its color or how the light changes color. The Red Sea is a body of water and won't dye a white shirt red. The answer is 3

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The coffee shop being too far would not prompt him to visit it in the evening rather than in the morning. The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home. The answer is 0.

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?
Model Answer (Wrong): People being in relationships or hiding in the restaurant does not explain why all tables are said to be reserved while there are no people. Likewise, people leaving the restaurant at the exact moment you passed doesn't seem plausible. However, none of the provided choices logically entail the situation presented in the question. So, the answer is 3.

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The ladder's size has no impact on how the person gets hurt or if the ladder is too tall for the boys. Regardless, medical attention would not prevent injury, but it would treat the injury. He was only on the first step. The answer is 1.

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The names of the first four children are given, and it is stated at the beginning that Mary's father is their father, thus the fifth child's name is Mary. The answer is 2

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): The police do not put out fires, so they wouldn't have put out the fire in any of the rooms. The fire department would be responsible for handling such situations. Therefore, the answer is 3

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): Assuming a constant daily increase, the total distance run can be calculated by taking the average of the first and last day's distances (because this is an arithmetic sequence) and multiplying the average by the number of days run (5). This would give the equation: 5/2 * (First Day + Last Day) = 70. Given that each day the runner ran 2km more than the previous day, the last day's distance would be First Day + 2*4 (as there were 4 increases over the 5-day period). Substituting this in, we get: 5/2 * (First Day + First Day + 8) = 70. Solving this equation, the First Day's distance is 10 kilometers. However, none of the options match this answer. Hence, The answer is 3.

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of the tractor wouldn't have fallen within hail to the island and it is also unlikely that the pieces of tractor floated over the lake. It is plausible that the tractor was driven over in winter when the lake was frozen. The answer is 2.

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fisherman caught one fish on the first day. If we think about it logically, he caught three more fish each day than the day before. So on each following day, he would have caught 4, 7, 10, and 13 fish respectively. When you add up all these numbers with the first day's catch, you get 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 which equals 35 fish. But the question stated that he caught 30 fish total, so the first day's catch had to be 1 fish, not 2 or 3. The answer is 1.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement 'Tony is not married' doesn't eliminate the possibility of him having children. Tony's nephew could be Jack's son. The answer is 0

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one bird is shot, the noise would scare the other birds off. So there would be none left on the fence. The answer is 3.

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being a superstar or finishing his dish completely doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't have to pay. The man goes to the restaurant everyday and doesn't pay because he works there. The answer is 0.

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement doesn't imply daughters getting married or brothers moving away. Each daughter shares the same brother, which is why Mrs. Jones only has five children. The answer is 2.

Question 96: You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?
Model Answer (Wrong): There are five heads of the organization and you, totaling six heads. The answer is 3.

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The national holiday or the cost of the hotel room are not related to the days mentioned in the question. His horse being named Sunday would explain why he was able to leave on Sunday and return the next day, which is also Sunday. The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The stations being too far away doesn't make sense because he goes to both of them. The stations and his home being on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter is plausible since the question mentioned the student leans forward while riding his scooter. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The chess team having backup players or some coaches getting a raise has nothing to do with the number of participants. If every player has one coach, but there are only six people, it is possible that each player shares the same coach. The answer is 0.

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Lisa being Emily's daughter would make Lisa also William's niece. Emily and William sharing the same father but not mother would not exclude Lisa from being Emily's niece. The only possible explanation is Emily is adopted, meaning she would not be a biological aunt to Lisa. The answer is 0.

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The distance of the first and second station have no impact on why he boards at the first stop and exits at the second. The stations and his home are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter. The answer is 1

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?
Model Answer (Wrong): Firemen do not have the authority to make arrests, hence they did not arrest anyone. The answer is 3.

Question 103: If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The first option is the only clear explanation. The other end of the rope is not tied to anything, which would allow the dog to reach the bone. The answer is 0.

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jessica cannot read in complete darkness if it is night or she is pretending to read. Jessica is blind and she can braille, allowing her to read in complete darkness. The answer is 2.

Question 105: A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man riding out of town on Sunday and coming back the next day on Sunday doesn't has any relation with a national holiday or the cost of the hotel room. The man's horse was named Sunday. He rode out on Sunday (the horse) and came back on Sunday (the horse). The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Amy being well exercised or the pet being strong would not prevent the pet from getting hurt. The pet dog must have fallen back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. The answer is 2

Question 107: Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You shoot one. How many are there left?
Model Answer (Wrong): The loud sound of the shot would likely scare the other birds into flying away, leaving none on the fence. The answer is 3

Question 108: He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A lawyer and a teacher do not necessarily marry many people. A preacher, however, often conducts wedding ceremonies, hence marries many people but is not necessarily married to them. The answer is 1.

Question 109: Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names. What is the name of the fifth child?
Model Answer (Wrong): The names of the four children are given as Nana, None, Nine, and Non. The fifth child is Mary. So, the answer is 2.

Question 110: Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?
Model Answer (Wrong): The other student's name must be Ana because she is part of the student count but her name is not listed with Maria, James, and Jonghyun. So, the answer is 1.

Question 111: A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a bruise. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman being strong would not negate her getting hurt in a 20-story fall. The fireman's physical abilities wouldn't affect if the woman got hurt from a fall. She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. The answer is 1.

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman or a superstar does not necessarily shave three times a day and still grow a beard. A barber, however, can shave other people three times a day and still grow their own beard. The answer is 1.

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The students using translation tools or external sources and their prior knowledge are both possibilities, but the question doesn't give any hint at that. Tom is a math teacher, numbers are the same in Chinese as they are in English, hence the students would still be able to do their homework even when printed in English. The answer is 1.

Question 114: If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea doesn't change the colour of the shirt. The Red Sea are not literally red, so the shirt will still be white. The answer is 2.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The people on the boat jumping into the sea or hiding themselves instantly is not logical. The phrase "not a single person" refers to the relationship status of the people on the boat, not the number. So, all the people on the boat are in relationships. The answer is 2.

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of fish caught increases each day, which implies that the fisherman caught the least amount of fish on the first day. Given the information and considering the pattern of increase every day, the fisherman must have started by catching one fish on the first day. The answer is 1.

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Bob could not use Google as the internet was disconnected. He may not need a membership to search on Google, and there's no correct way to search Google. The answer is 2.

Question 118: He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?
Model Answer (Wrong): He has wed numerous women but has never done so himself. The person who performs wedding ceremonies is a preacher. The answer is 1
