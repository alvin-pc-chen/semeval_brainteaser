System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen?
                Choices: 0 = His hair is dyed.; 1 = This man is bald.; 2 = This man walk upside down to avoid rain.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Samuel got wet from the rain, but no hair on his head got wet. If Samuel dyed his hair it would still be wet. Samuel is bald, so his hair didn't get wet. The answer is 1
                Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: That the rope is not tied to anything else is the simplest choice. The horse can reach the hay whenever he chooses. The answer is 1

                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time. If the woman did not get divorced or legally separated, she cannot be legally married to more than one person. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?
                Choices: 0 = Old money weight more than new money.; 1 = Old money is dirtier than new money.; 2 = Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: 1968 and 1967 refer to the number of pennies. The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies. The answer is 2
                Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come?
                Choices: 0 = The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 1 = The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 2 = The teacher was in an orphanage school.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even if the teacher had informed all the parents or all the students in advance about the unique disciplinary approach, it is unlikely that nobody would object. If the teacher is in an orphange school, there would be no parents to object. The answer is 2
                Question: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?
                Choices: 0 = Home.; 1 = The way to the pond.; 2 = Pond.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them are lost, 27 - 5 = 22. Thirteen of them are staying home, 22 - 13 = 9. Nine of them are at the pond, 9 - 9 = 0. There are no more ducks so the question is invalid. The answer is 3
                Question: How many birth days does the average person have?
                Choices: 0 = People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.; 1 = They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.; 2 = It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Everyone is born only once so technically the average person has one birthday in their lifetime. The answer is 1
                Question: The more you take, the more you leave behind
                Choices: 0 = Love.; 1 = Footsteps.; 2 = Money.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Footsteps. The more you walk, the more footsteps you leave behind. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lazy farmer is his mother. This is the case because the diligent farmer's father is not specified. Thus, it is possible that the diligent farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, who is his mother. The answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The presence of glass shards and water on the floor suggests a fish tank may have been present. Romeo and Juliet are not necessarily people; they could be fish that died when their tank fell off the shelf and broke due to the tremors from the passing train. The answer is 2

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): Each day before your birthday, you are technically one year younger than you will be tomorrow. This happens every year. The answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sporting organization, if the assistant captain departs, the captain of the team would still continue in his role. Therefore, the captain would serve as the team's captain. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you're picking names from the phone directory, those individuals have listed phone numbers. People with unlisted numbers would not be in the phone directory. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they could still see each other's faces if they were not standing back to back. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): A house cannot jump at all. Thus, no matter how high the dog jumps, it will always jump higher than a house. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): Technically, you can divide 100 by 10 once to get a whole number answer. Subsequent divisions will result in decimal numbers. Thus, the answer is 1

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The problem does not provide enough information to determine exactly how many new criminals the police will be able to find. The answer is 3

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. The answer is 1

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male chickens and males of any species do not lay eggs. So the farmer can't get eggs from roosters. The answer is 1

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide any information on the playground, Mark's preferences, or his position relative to different players. Therefore, based on the information provided in the question, we cannot accurately determine why Mark chose to take a photo with the football player. The answer is 3

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man who stayed completely dry even though it was raining, was not moving. The most logical choice is that he couldn't move. Man was in a coffin. The answer is 2

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman saw a bear far away but she wasn't afraid and she ran towards it. This can happen if she was at the zoo and the bear was in an enclosed space. The answer is 0

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The simplest answer is that the two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other, allowing the man to jump from one to the other. It doesn't say anything about him being an athlete or the houses being different heights. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant could still be the attorney's sibling by being his sister. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant referred to the attorney as "my brother," implying that the accountant identifies as a sibling to the attorney. The attorney, however, said he didn't have a brother - but he didn't say anything about not having a sister. The most logical explanation is that the accountant is indeed his sister. So, the answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): When considering the relationships, one of the mothers is the grandmother of the daughter, who is also the daughter of the other mother. This makes up a total of 3 people: a daughter, a mother, and a grandmother. Thus, each of them can have $7. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all of the man's children are boys, then it would be true to say that half of them are boys (as well as the other half). Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): Taking the first medicine doesn't require a half-hour wait, so the second dose will be at the half-hour point and the third dose will be an hour after the first dose. Therefore, the medicines will keep you going for an hour, and the answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): A house cannot jump at all, so any height the dog is able to jump would be higher than the house. The answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): The ground not being wet is the simplest explanation for this person's feet staying dry despite them not wearing rubber boots during their trek. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs. Therefore, the egg could not have been laid by the rooster. The answer is 1

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Given how James was surrounded by hungry bears yet they just looked at him and left, it makes most sense that this happened at a zoo, where bears can't harm visitors. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill at the start, the second half an hour later and the third pill another half an hour later. So in total, the pills last you an hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): After you subtract 10 from 100 once, 100 becomes 90. So, you can deduct 10 from 100 only once. The answer is 0.

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being triplets could explain why they can be from the same family, have the same parents, were born on the same day, but are not twins. The answer is 0.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Romeo and Juliet are, in this scenario, fish. The nearby train's rumbling caused the fish tank on the shelf to fall and break, leaving pieces of glass and water on the floor. Romeo and Juliet as fish couldn't survive out of water, consequently leading to their death. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The coach of a team is generally the person who leads the team in the absence of the vice coach. The answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that the policeman heard someone scream "No John, not the gun!" and then saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body. The policeman instantly knew the killer was the mailman. The only logical explanation is that the mailman was the only male, while the doctor and the lawyer were females. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the options are inherently true. Old people do not necessarily consume more food than young people, each individual's food consumption can vary widely based on variables such as metabolic rate, activity level, and overall health. The answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack was swimming in the ocean. If Jack is a fish, then a sudden wave knocking him out of the water and making it impossible for him to return would cause him to die. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog can't be the thin dog's father because it's the thin dog's mother. It's entirely possible for the fat dog to be the small dog's parent as the mother. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens lay eggs. So, the egg couldn't have rolled down anywhere because there was no egg to begin with. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the given choices logically explain why the person who didn't move remained dry while the others who sought shelter got wet, thus the answer is 3. An additional information that is missing could be that this person was already under cover.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): There are actually three people: a grandmother, her daughter, and her granddaughter. Here, grandmother could be a mother to her daughter and the daughter could be a mother to her granddaughter. Each can be given $7. So the answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): Unlisted phone numbers are not included in a city's phone directory, so if you select 100 names from that directory, none of them will have unlisted phone numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): The information provided states that four of the men who fled got wet, yet the one who remained got totally dry. If a living person stays out in the rain, regardless of his athletic ability or luck, he would still get wet. However, if he was in a coffin, he would remain dry regardless of the rain because the coffin would offer protection against the rain. This implies that they were at his funeral. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The riddle asks how it's possible to divide $40 equally amongst Jack, Tom, and their parents. The answer could be that Jack and Tom are brothers and share the same parents, in which case there would only be four people (Jack, Tom, and each of their parents). Thus the answer is 2.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question doesn't provide any logical reason for white sheep to eat more than black sheep based on color. However, if there are more white sheep than black sheep, total food consumption by white sheep could be higher. The answer is 0.

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the woman were out in the wild and saw a bear, it would be unusual not to feel fear, regardless of sudden bravery. If she is at the zoo, there is a protective barrier between her and the bear, so she wouldn't be afraid. The answer is 1

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right "before" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. The answer is 1

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is tricky and the answer depends on the wording. Before any basketball game starts, the score is always 0-0. In this case, John predicted the score would be 0-0 before a basketball game. Therefore, he was right and Tom lost the bet. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the assistant captain of a sports team were to resign, the team would typically be led by the captain. The answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can subtract 10 from 100 only once. After the first subtraction, it is no longer 100, it’s 90. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Since the question doesn't specify the color of the remaining sheep, the fact half of the flock is white suggests that all sheep may be white. Hence, it is possible that all of the 11 sheep are white. The answer is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The officer arrested James and said "I don't have a brother anymore"; however, James didn't have a brother either. This can be explained by the fact that the officer was actually his sister. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Since half of nine is 4.5, it is not possible for there to be half male children. All of the children being male is the only option that makes sense in accordance with the question. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fact that they are not twins despite being born on the same date and having the same parents suggests that there might be more than two of them - they could be part of a set of triplets, quadruplets, etc. So the answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the field was not wet, there would be no need for rubber boots. If the third man was walking on his hands, his hands would have gotten wet. It is logical to say that by walking on stilts, the third man can keep his feet dry while walking on the field. The answer is 1.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. John predicted the score before the game started, so Tom lost the bet. The answer is 0

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): There is a mistake in the choices, none of them logically answer the question. This is because in the details given, there are not enough facts to conclude who 'John' is. The answer is 3.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for five times, assuming each stop doesn't consume time, therefore the total time for the stops is 2 and a half hours. The answer is 1

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fish tank is likely in a round or ring shape. It's not about the fishes reflecting or having unusual vision. So, if they swim in opposite directions, they can manage to see each other every few minutes as they round the tank. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of black sheep is not as much as the number of white sheep in the world, hence the total number of black sheep eating would be less than the total number of white sheep eating. The answer is 2.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): They are two of three triplets. This would mean that they share the same appearance and the same birthday, but they are not identical twins due to the presence of a third triplet. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The three men are crossing a lush and muddy meadow, meaning the ground is wet. Even if the third man is not wearing rubber boots, his feet are still dry. If he was walking on stilts or doing a handstand, his feet would be raised above the wet ground. Both choices 1 and 2 are feasible.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog is the mother of the thin dog. If the fat dog is not the father, the only other parent that the fat dog could be is the mother. So, the answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards were facing opposite directions, but if they were not back to back and were instead facing each other, one guard could observe the other's facial expressions. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day always fall in the same year. The answer is 1

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): Yellowstone is a name and not a color, hence putting a white shirt on it will not necessarily turn the shirt yellow. The answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lion is tied to a 6m long piece of metal but the human is 7m away. If the other end of the rope the lion is tied to is not tied to anything, the lion could reach the human. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): Despite the mention of several animals, the question only focuses on 'legs on the ground' - the legs of the animals would not count since they are on the bed. Therefore, there are four bed legs and two human legs, giving a total of six legs on the ground. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman fell from the first-floor balcony, not from a higher balcony. This is not explicitly mentioned in the question, but it's the only logical explanation. None of the given choices are correct. The answer is 3.

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A barber can shave other people three times a day and still maintain a beard if they choose to keep one themselves. So, the answer is 1.

Model Answer (Wrong): The question is about not cracking a raw egg when you drop it onto a concrete floor. However, the answer choice 2 cleverly changes the interpretation to refer to not cracking the concrete floor instead. The answer is 2

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man is blind and is reading braille. This choice satisfies all conditions of the story. The man was able to read his book even though there was no source of light since he read a book in Braille. So, the answer is 2.

Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tractor could have been driven over in winter when the lake was frozen. This would allow it to get to the island without being transported by boat or air, and without being built on the island. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if Sally's teachers do not speak French, math is a universal language. The numbers and mathematical symbols would be the same regardless of the language. So the teacher who would most likely understand her work is her math teacher. The answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man rode back on his horse, which was named Sunday. The answer is 0.

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If a man jumps off a 50-story building from the top, he will get hurt. However, if he jumps off the ground floor, he isn't really jumping from a height, so he wouldn't get hurt. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): He fell off a 100 foot ladder but was not injured. The height of the ladder matters less than the distance the boy fell. If he was on the first step, his fall would not be enough to injure him. The answer is 2

There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man is blind and reading braille. The story states that there is no light in the house, yet the man is happily reading. Braille, a system of tactile writing utilized by people who are blind or visually impaired, would allow this man to read without needing light. The answer is 1.

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea doesn't necessarily mean that it would turn red. The Red Sea is simply a name and it does not indicate the color of the water. None of the given options logically follow from the situation described. The answer is 3.

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the answer choices provides a logical explanation for the worker's routine. He might have personal preferences for different types of coffee or the atmosphere of each shop, but these reasons are not represented in the available answers. The answer is 3

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was only on the first step of the ladder when he fell off, he would not be harmed by the fall. The other options suggest conditions that would render harm more likely or do not logically explain a lack of injury. The answer is 1.

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The beginning of the question states "Mary's father has five children". This implies that one of the children is named Mary. Therefore, the fifth child's name is Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide information about the order in which the policemen put out the fires. It may seem logical to prioritize based on the value of what's in each room, but that decision would vary among individuals. It doesn't specify that policemen are firefighters, their primary duty is not to extinguish fires. The answer is 3

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): The runner increased his run two kilometers each day for five days which forms an arithmetic progression. You can express the total distance he ran, 70 kilometers, as the sum of his daily runs. We'll call the distance he ran on the first day X. 

Given: Total distance ran = 70km,
Total days = 5,
difference between consecutive days' runs = 2km.

We can say that X+(X+2)+(X+4)+(X+6)+(X+8)=70,

Or 5*X + 20 = 70

So X, or the distance run on the first day, equals 70-20/5 = 10 kilometers. None of the answer choices match this, so the answer is 3.

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland.

It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tractor couldn't have been dropped by hail or float over the lake. The most logical response is that it was driven over in winter when the lake was frozen. The answer is 2

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): In order for the fisherman to catch three more fish each day, he must have started with a smaller number on the first day. Since he caught 30 fish in 5 days, this can be broken down to: 
1. Day 1: x number of fish
2. Day 2: x+3 fish
3. Day 3: x+6 fish 
4. Day 4: x+9 fish
5. Day 5: x+12 fish

Adding all these values together, the sum is 30 fish:
5x + 30 = 30
5x=0
x=0

This indicates that he did not catch any fish on the first day. However, this is not a provided option in the choices. Hence, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Tony's nephew can be Jack's son. This is the only way Tony's nephew would not also be Jack's nephew. The answer is 0.

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If a man goes to a restaurant every day without paying, the most reasonable explanation is that he works there at the restaurant. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The student lives on a hill with both train stations located downhill in opposite directions. So, in the morning, he just scoots downhill to the first train station. In the afternoon, he gets off at the second station and then rides down back home. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the choices logically explain why the student boards at the first stop in the morning and exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Thus, the answer is 3

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?

Model Answer (Wrong): The phrase "rode out of town on Sunday" and "rode back to town the next day on Sunday" cannot logically happen unless Sunday refers to something other than a day of the week, such as a name. The only choice that supports this reasoning is choice 2, His horse was called Sunday. The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): As the homework was printed in English, the students wouldn't have been able to understand it without using translation tools or external help, and relying on prior knowledge to guess the homework answers would be risky. If Tom is a math teacher, language wouldn't be much of a problem since numbers are the same in Chinese as in English. The answer is 1.
