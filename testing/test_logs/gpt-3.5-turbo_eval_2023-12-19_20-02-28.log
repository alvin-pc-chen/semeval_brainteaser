System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Using commonsense reasoning, find the best choice for the following question:



Question 1: Everyone called him "Batman," but he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting. He still cherished being referred to as Batman! How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice is 3) None of the above. The passage states that "he knew nothing about bats and thought they were disgusting," suggesting that none of the given choices adequately explain why he still cherishes being referred to as Batman.

Question 2: All of Mrs. Smith pets are dogs except one, and all her pets are cats except one. But Mrs.Smith only has 2 pets, how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 2 = Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog. This is because it is possible for Mrs. Smith to have one pet that is a dog and one pet that is a cat, which would satisfy the given conditions.

Question 3: Three doors are present. Every door has a way to exit. The first door has lava and fire inside. Lions behind the second door haven't eaten in five years. There is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator inside the third door. Which door will you probably get through?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice would be Option 3: None of the above.

Question 4: Tom and his younger sister were fighting. Their mother was tired of the fighting and decided to punish them by making them stand on the same piece of newspaper in such a way that they couldn't touch each other. How did she accomplish this?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question is option 1: "Tom and his younger sister stand on the newspaper back-to-back." This choice logically follows from the information provided in the question, where the mother wanted to ensure that they couldn't touch each other. Having them stand back-to-back on the newspaper achieves this goal.

Question 5: A woman sells a bottle of perfume to a man for $5.00 and receives a $20 bill from him. She doesn't have change, so she goes to the bakery next door to get it. She comes back and gives the man $15.00. After the man leaves, the baker comes over and says, "That bill you gave me was counterfeit." The woman gives the baker a real $20 bill. How much has the woman lost?
Model Answer (Wrong): The correct choice is 2 = Twenty-five dollars. 
Explanation: The woman initially received a $20 bill from the man and gave him back $15. However, the bill turned out to be counterfeit, so she had to give the baker a real $20 bill for the change she initially received from the man. Therefore, she lost the $5 that she was supposed to receive as change, as well as the $20 bill she gave to the baker, totaling $25.

Question 6: An individual shoots their spouse. She continues by keeping him submerged for over five minutes. She hangs him finally. However, they go out together and have a fantastic supper five minutes later. Why is this the case?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the most logical choice would be 1 = The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.

Question 7: In Jamaica, if you drop a steel ball weighing five pounds from a height of 45 inches, it falls more rapidly through the water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 0 = The temperature of stell ball is more consistent with water in 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Question 8: Two camels were facing in opposite directions. One was facing due East and one was facing due West. They were in the desert so there was no reflection. How can they manage to see each other without walking around or turning around or moving their heads?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice would be option 2: The two camels were facing each other the entire time.

Question 9: In Jamaica, some kids can stand on the water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the given question would be: 2 = At 20 degrees Fahrenheit the water would be ice.

Question 10: A five-pound steel ball will fall through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit more quickly than water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit if it is dropped from a height of 45 inches in Jamaica. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question would be: 2 = The temperature of the steel ball is more consistent with water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This is because the question states that the steel ball will fall more quickly through water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit as compared to water at 20 degrees Fahrenheit. This implies that the steel ball is more compatible with water at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Question 11: A boy had just finished getting ready for his prom, shaving, applying cologne, and there would be an after-party. His parents had told him to be home for the next sunrise, but he arrived with a full-grown beard instead. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is option 2: "His beard grows at an amazing speed." This choice provides a logical explanation for how the boy could have a full-grown beard despite his parents' instructions to be home before sunrise.

Question 12: There were eight girls going to school. They were sharing one umbrella. How come all the girls did not get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 0 = The eight girls could have been sharing the umbrella at different times or taking turns using it. This is a plausible explanation as it would allow all the girls to avoid getting wet despite sharing one umbrella.

Question 13: In the midst of a plumbing shutdown, Jack was stuck on the tenth floor of an apartment building fixing a leaky pipe. The elevator was out of order due to the plumbing issue. How did he manage to get out of the building before the plumbing was fixed?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice would be 1 = Jack used the stairs. He was fixing the leaky pipe inside the apartment, not trapped in the elevator. This is the most logical and plausible solution, as the question states that Jack was stuck on the tenth floor of the building, and the elevator was out of order. Therefore, using the stairs would be the most reasonable way for Jack to get out before the plumbing was fixed.

Question 14: A beggar's brother died, but the man who died had no brother. How could that be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question would be option 3 - "None of the above." None of the provided choices provide a logical explanation for how the beggar's brother died despite not having a brother.

Question 15: There were two camels facing in different directions. One was facing directly East, and the other directly West. There was no reflection because they were in the desert. How do they manage to see one another without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 0 = The two camels were facing each other the entire time. Hence facing in opposite directions. This choice best explains how the camels manage to see one another without turning around, moving their heads, or moving around.

Question 16: When there was a severe power outage, George was on the eighth floor of an office building cleaning the windows. He had disabled the electric hoist on his platform. So how did he escape before the power was turned back on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice would be 0 = George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows. Since George disabled the electric hoist on his platform and there was a severe power outage, it is logical to assume that he would have used an alternative method to escape. Walking down the stairs would be a reasonable choice.

Question 17: Although Dorothy has never stated suicide ideas, whenever she feels down or depressed, she makes plans to go to a very high location that she has frequented before. Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards. What is going on here, and why has she never been hurt or, worse still, killed as a result of her dangerous behavior, if she isn't suicidal?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 1 = Dorothy is a sky jumper.

Question 18: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is: 2 = He lived in a lighthouse.

Question 19: I dig out tiny caves and store gold and silver in them. I also build bridges of silver and make crowns of gold. They are the smallest you could imagine. Sooner or later everybody needs my help, yet many people are afraid to let me help them. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 0 = I am a miner.

Question 20: A man walking along a railroad track sees a train laundering at high speed towards him. Instead of immediately jumping off the track, he charges directly at the train for about ten feet and only then gets off the track. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the given question is option 2: By moving towards the oncoming train, the man's brain interprets the change in distance and relative motion as a decrease in speed.

Question 21: George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor of an office block when there was a massive power failure. The electric hoist on his platform was immoblized. So how did he manage to get down before the power was restored?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice for the question would be "2 = George walked down the stairs. He was cleaning the inside of the windows." Since George was cleaning the windows on the eighteenth floor, and the electric hoist on his platform was immobilized due to a power failure, it is logical to assume that George would have to rely on an alternative means of getting down. Walking down the stairs seems like a plausible solution in this scenario.

Question 22: One evening, Joe and Sally were relaxing in their family room. Sally, Joe's wife, was reading while he was watching television. The moment the electricity went out, Joe made the decision to retire to bed, but Sally continued to read. Sally carried on reading without using any artificial lighting. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 0 = Because it was daytime. This choice is logical as it explains how Sally continued reading without using any artificial lighting when the electricity went out.

Question 23: A woman living in Rome legally gave birth to five children, but she has never been pregnant. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the given question would be 0 = The woman is a surrogate mother. This choice is plausible because surrogacy is a process where a woman carries a pregnancy and gives birth to a child, but the child is genetically related to someone else. In this case, the woman in Rome could have legally given birth to five children as a surrogate, even though she has never been pregnant herself.

Question 24: A woman shoots publicly at people at a National Park. The park is full of people, but no one gets killed. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 0 = The woman was a photographer. This is because a photographer could shoot publicly at people in a National Park without causing harm or intending any harm.

Question 25: All but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs, and all but one are cats. But how is it possible that Mrs. Smith only has two pets?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice would be 2 = Mrs. Smith has one cat and one dog. This would satisfy the statement that "all but one of Mrs. Smith's pets are dogs" and "all but one are cats." Having one cat and one dog would not contradict these statements and would explain how Mrs. Smith only has two pets.

Question 26: A woman is found dead in a field of snow. The only tracks are her own leading up to her. There are no signs of struggle, no other footprints, and no other evidence. Only an abandoned pack of balloons is found nearby. How did she die?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, there are no signs of struggle, no other footprints, and no other evidence. The only thing found nearby is an abandoned pack of balloons. Therefore, the most logical choice would be 0 = She was in a hot air balloon which was losing altitude and crashed.

Question 27: There is a man who everyone calls "Lightning," yet he's afraid of storms and has no interest in meteorology. Despite this, he is delighted when people refer to him as "Lightning." How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice would be option 2: "He tries to be friendly." Despite being afraid of storms and having no interest in meteorology, the man is still delighted when people call him "Lightning." This suggests that he enjoys the attention and the positive association that comes with the nickname. It implies that he tries to be friendly and likable to others.

Question 28: I break down walls and devour towers. I consume iron and corrode steel, but still, I am essential to all. Sometimes, people desire me, yet they fear my uncontrolled presence. What am I?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question "I break down walls and devour towers. I consume iron and corrode steel, but still, I am essential to all. Sometimes, people desire me, yet they fear my uncontrolled presence. What am I?" would be 3 = None of above.

This is because none of the answer choices directly relate to the description given in the question. Oxygen, sound, and sunshine do not break down walls, consume iron, corrode steel, or have uncontrolled presence that people fear. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given choices.

Question 29: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses.How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question is 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.

Question 30: Two lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island, one faces due North and the other due South. They never turn or rotate. How can they both illuminate the same ship at the same time?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is "1 = The ship is exactly in between the two lighthouses."
This choice is logically entailed by the information given in the question. Since the lighthouses are situated back to back on the same island and one faces due North while the other faces due South, the ship would need to be exactly in between the two lighthouses in order for both of them to illuminate it at the same time.

Question 31: Emily stands outside a building. She doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go in to find out. Where is Emily?
Model Answer (Wrong): From the information given, Emily stands outside a building and doesn't know what time it is, but she knows she has to go inside to find out. Therefore, the best choice for Emily's location would be the clock store (choice 2) since that is where she would most likely find out the time.

Question 32: How can a pilot take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 3 = None of above. None of the given choices provide a logical solution to how a pilot can take off in Los Angeles on Tuesday, fly for 48 hours, and land in Tokyo on Tuesday.

Question 33: A shooter put his hat away and donned a blindfold. He then made a 100-yard walk, turned around, and shot a bullet in the hat. The man's vision was completely obscured by the effective blindfold. How did he pull this off?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the most plausible choice for how the shooter pulled off shooting the bullet into his hat with his vision obscured is: 
2 = He uses the sound to feel the direction. 

This is because even though his vision was completely obscured, he could still use his sense of hearing to determine the direction of the hat and aim his shot accordingly. Hanging his hat on the barrel of his gun (choice 0) or using a computer to compute his actions (choice 1) would not be feasible solutions in this scenario. Therefore, the answer is 2 = He uses the sound to feel the direction.

Question 34: There are three doors. In each door is a way to die. The first door has fire and lava. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years. In the third door, there is a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator. Which door will you likely survive?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question would be 3 = None of the above. None of the answer choices provide a logical and plausible explanation for surviving any of the three doors. The first door has fire and lava, which are deadly. The second door has lions that haven't eaten in 5 years, but there is no evidence to suggest they have died. The third door has a 1,000-foot drop into an alligator, which is also deadly. Therefore, the most reasonable choice is none of the above, as there is no door that you are likely to survive.

Question 35: A sharpshooter hung up his hat and put on a blindfolded. He then walked 100 yards, turned around, and shot a bullet through his hat. The blindfolded was a perfectly good one, completely blocking the man's vision. How did he manage this?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question is: 0 = He uses the sound to feel the direction.

Question 36: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question is 3 = None of above. None of the given choices accurately explain the situation described in the question. Dororthy's behavior of jumping from a high spot whenever she feels sadness or depression is not explained by any of the given options.

Question 37: After moving into a new home, a man decided that he was exhausted from the trip and turned out all the lights before retiring to bed. He did not sleepwalk the night before he killed 365 people; instead, he slept soundly. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice would be 2 = The man could be a calendar maker. He accidentally excluded February 29th on a leap year's calendar. This "killed" the day for 365 people.

Question 38: Craig passed away there. Tracy passed away at sea shortly after. No one was sad; in fact, everyone was ecstatic. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, it is possible to infer that the reason why no one was sad and everyone was ecstatic is because Craig and Tracy passing away is seen as a positive event. Therefore, the best choice would be 2 = People are getting used to it, as it implies that the passage of individuals is expected and does not elicit sadness.

Question 39: Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning and the given information, the best choice for the question is: 1 = Each daughter shares the same brother.

Question 40: A woman shoots her husband. Then she holds him underwater for over 5 minutes. Finally, she hangs him. But 5 minutes later, they both go out and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the question "How can this be?" would be option 2: The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry. This choice aligns with the given scenario, where the actions described refer to the woman's photography process rather than actual harm or murder.

Question 41: A train is approaching a man who is strolling down a railroad track quickly. He charges directly at the train for roughly 10 feet before finally jumping off the track instead of doing so right away. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the question would be 1 = By moving towards the train momentarily, the man minimizes the risk of being hit directly by the front of the train. This choice suggests that the man's actions were intended to reduce the likelihood of a direct collision with the train.

Question 42: Mary was enjoying a peaceful paddle in her inflatable kayak on a narrow river. As she turned a bend, she realized that the river became significantly narrower, too narrow for her kayak to pass through. She can't paddle backward due to the strong current. A fellow kayaker on the shore knew how to solve her predicament. What was his suggestion?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice would be 0 = He suggested that she deflate her kayak slightly. This option makes sense because if the river became significantly narrower, deflating the kayak slightly would make it smaller and therefore more likely to fit through the narrow section.

Question 43: A famed pilot walks 100 yards away from his plane, puts on a blindfold, and then flies his plane through a ring hanging in the sky, all without any technological assistance or help from others. His vision was entirely obscured by the blindfold. How did he do this?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice based on commonsense reasoning for the question is:
2 = Before putting on the blindfold, the pilot attached the ring to the front of his plane.

Question 44: A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice seems to be "0 = The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately." This choice suggests a valid reason for the woman to not step off the path immediately as she might have been on a narrow cliff path where stepping off immediately would have put her at risk.

Question 45: Emma was making a peach cobbler. After peeling and chopping all the peaches, she realized that she had to add a teaspoon of cinnamon for every four peaches. How did she figure out how much cinnamon to add?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 3 = None of the above. 

From the information given, it is clear that Emma figured out how much cinnamon to add by determining the ratio of a teaspoon of cinnamon for every four peaches. There is no mention of her cooking skills or knowledge of physics, and the option 2 (counting the peach pits) is not related to determining the amount of cinnamon to add.

Question 46: A man took his son to a baseball game. The coach of the team saw the man and said, "That boy is my son." Yet, the man at the baseball game was the boy's father. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 0 = The coach of the team is the boy's mother.

Question 47: A car accident involving a father and son resulted in the death of the father. The son was transported to the hospital by ambulance. He required surgery right away. A doctor entered the operating room and said, "I can't operate on him. He's my son." after taking one look at the young patient. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 1 = Because the doctor is the mother of the son.

Question 48: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 2 = Each daughter shares the same brother. This is because the statement "The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother" indicates that all six daughters share one brother, which would result in a total of seven siblings. Therefore, the family can consist of nine people if the parents are included, making this choice the most logical.

Question 49: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Then Juliana went out for a phone call and came back several minutes later. However, there were new liquid in the five finished drinks. Maria didn't leap her drink to Juliana's and no one is around. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice for this question would be 2 = The ice in the drinks melted and became water.

Question 50: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice for the question is option 2: "I am a miner." The passage mentions excavating little caves, keeping gold and silver there, and creating gold crowns and silver bridges. These activities are closely associated with mining for precious metals and materials. 

Question 51: In front of an old saloon, a horse is chained to a five-meter rope. Hay bale is ten meters behind the horse. The horse can eat the hay whenever he wants without severing his rope. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the given question is choice 1: "The rope is not tied to anything else." This choice implies that the horse is not actually constrained by the rope and can freely move around, allowing it to reach the hay bale.

Question 52: A couple is having a disagreement over the man's error. The man kept apologizing and pleading with the woman to allow him to see her directly. The woman was still upset. Thus, she wouldn't agree. The couple, though, was positioned on the same mat. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the provided information, the best choice for the question would be 1 = The woman kept turning her back to the man. The reason is that the passage states that the woman is still upset and wouldn't agree, suggesting that she is intentionally avoiding direct communication with the man.

Question 53: Several harvested radishes were once stolen from a neighbor by a slothful farmer. The radishes were missing, so his neighbor reported it to the police. The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 1 = There are no dew on the radishes, so they were not harvested from his own farm on the morning. 

This choice is the best because if the radishes were truly harvested from the farmer's own farm that morning, there should be dew on them. The absence of dew on the radishes suggests that they were not harvested from the farmer's own farm.

Question 54: Wednesday, Tom and Joe had dinner at a restaurant. After finishing, they paid and departed. Joe and Tom don't have to pay. Who paid the bill?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question would be 3 = None of the above. This is because the sentence "Joe and Tom don't have to pay" implies that someone else paid the bill. None of the other choices provide a logical explanation for who paid the bill.

Question 55: Which would see most clearly in total darkness? A bat, a tiger, or an owl.
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice would be 2 = Bat.

Question 56: A magician had a water glass that was filled to the top. Holding the glass above his head he let it drop to the carpet without spilling a single drop of water. How could he manage to drop the glass from a height of six feet and not spill any water?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 2 = Surface tension prevents water from spilling.

Question 57: Morgan is dying near the sea line. Many people witness her death but no one feel sad. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the question would be "0 = People are getting used to it." If many people witness Morgan's death near the sea line but do not feel sad, it implies that it has become a common occurrence and people have become desensitized to such events.

Question 58: Even though Matthew has never expressed any desire to endanger himself, whenever he feels stressed or overwhelmed, he makes plans to visit a certain deep spot that he has visited many times before. Once there, he decides to plunge into the profound depth. The astonishing thing is that he has never been hurt because of his dive, and he even says he feels much better afterwards. What is happening here, and why has he never been injured or, even worse, killed as a result of his risky behavior, if he isn't trying to harm himself?
Model Answer (Wrong): Choice 0: Matthew is a deep-sea diver.
Choice 1: Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.
Choice 2: Matthew was just raving to show he is outstanding.
Choice 3: None of the above.

Based on the information provided, the best choice would be Choice 0: Matthew is a deep-sea diver. This choice is supported by the fact that Matthew makes plans to visit a certain deep spot and plunges into the profound depth. This suggests that he has experience diving in deep waters and knows how to handle himself safely.

Question 59: How could a cowboy ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday?
Model Answer (Wrong): Choice 3 = None of the above is the best choice. The logical explanation for how a cowboy could ride into town on Friday, stay two days, and ride out on Wednesday is that there is an error or contradiction in the question or the answer choices provided.

Question 60: There once was an evil wizard. He took 3 woman from their homes and turned them into rose bushes that looked exactly alike. He put them in his garden. One of the woman had a husband and children and begged the wizard to let her see them. He agreed. At night, he brought the woman to her house. In the morning he came and took her home. One day the husband decided to go rescue her. So he stuck into the wizard's garden. He looked and looked at the 3 identical rose bushes trying to figure out which could be his wife. Suddenly, he knew the answer and he took his wife home. How did he know which rose bush was his wife?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 1 = The wizard brought the rose bush to her home at night and returned her to the garden in the morning. Therefore, she was the only plant without dew.

Question 61: Even if they are starving, natives living in the Arctic will never eat a penguin's egg. Why not?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be choice 2: Penguins and their eggs are not part of their traditional or cultural diet.

Question 62: A man uses the elevator since he is too old to use his crutch to ascend to the 12th floor. He is asked to hit the 17th button by a woman who is taller than him because she is unable to do it herself. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be option 1: The old man was granted exclusive access to the higher floors. This choice aligns with the information provided in the question, where the man is too old to use his crutch and is using the elevator to ascend to the 12th floor. The fact that the woman asks him to press the 17th button suggests that he has special access to the higher floors. The other options do not provide a logical explanation for the situation described.

Question 63: Two men were playing tennis. They played five sets and each man won three sets. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the given question is: 0 = The two men were partners playing doubles.

Question 64: Who would hear the quietest sound in a completely soundproof room? A dog, a dolphin, or a bat?
Model Answer (Wrong): 0 = Bat.

Question 65: The brother of a police passed away, but the dead man actually had no brother. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for this question would be 3 = None of above. Since the dead man actually had no brother, none of the other choices offer a logical explanation for the situation.

Question 66: Two cops walked into a room with no windows and found a dead man who obviously hung himself from the ceiling, though they couldn't figure out how. There was no chair beneath him that he might have jumped off of, or a table. Just a paddle of water. How'd he do it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question would be 1 = He stood on a block of ice until it melted.

Question 67: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice for the question would be: 0 = An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.

Question 68: A woman who lives in New York legally wed three men; she didn't get divorced, enroll, or separate from them in any other way. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the most logical choice would be option 2: "She is a minister." This suggests that the woman in question could have performed wedding ceremonies in her capacity as a minister, without being legally married to the three men herself.

Question 69: Juliana and Maria went out for drinks collectively. They placed a joint drink order. In the time it took Maria to finish one, Juliana, who was extremely thirsty, finished five. Only Maria perished despite the drinks being poisoned. How?

Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 2 = Because the doctor is the mother of the son. This choice aligns with the logical inference that the doctor is a female and is therefore the mother of the son. This scenario challenges traditional gender roles, which is why it may require commonsense reasoning to identify the correct answer.

Question 72: Despite sharing the same parents, the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): By using commonsense reasoning, we can eliminate choices that do not logically explain how the 22nd and 24th presidents of the United States of America were not related. 

Choice 0: The 24th president having better performance during tenure does not provide an explanation for the lack of the relationship between the presidents.

Choice 1: Their parents getting divorced also does not explain why the presidents were not related, as divorce does not automatically sever family ties.

Choice 2: They were the same man does not align with the premise that they were different individuals who shared the same parents.

Therefore, the best choice based on commonsense reasoning would be:
Choice 3: None of the above, as none of the provided choices logically explain how the 22nd and 24th presidents were not related despite sharing the same parents.

Question 73: A man moved into a new house and decided he was tired after the journey and turned off all the lights and went to bed. The next morning he killed 365 people, he does not sleep walk he slept like a baby. How could this be?

Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice is "2 = The secretary was the girl's father." This is because the secretary claimed that the little girl was her daughter, implying that she is related to the girl.

Question 76: A man gives a woman a $10 bill and pays her $3 for a rope. To get change, the woman enters the grocery store right next door. When she comes back, she gives the man $7. Hey, that was a counterfeit bill you gave me, the store clerk says as the customer leaves. The lady hands the cashier a decent bill. How much has she lost in total?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice for the question would be 2 = Seven dollars. The woman gave the man $10, received $7 from the grocery store as change, and then had to give the cashier a decent bill to replace the counterfeit one. Therefore, she lost a total of $7.

Question 77: There was a man who everybody called Batman he knew nothing about bats and thought they were gross. He still loved it when people called him Batman! How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): Using commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the given question would be 3 = None of above. None of the answer choices provided explain why the man loves it when people call him Batman despite knowing nothing about bats and thinking they are gross.

Question 78: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice would be 2 = The station wasn't fixed in the marina.

Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the most plausible choice would be 2) The secretary was the girl's father. It is possible that the woman's daughter is also the daughter of the secretary, which would explain why the secretary referred to the little girl as "my daughter."

Question 80: One the final exam day, Tom's father send him to one classroom. A teacher came over and said " Tom can not take exam under my supervise as he is my son." Then Tom is asked to switch to another room. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information given, the best choice is 0 = Because the teacher is the mother of Tom. The question states that the teacher said "Tom cannot take the exam under my supervision as he is my son." This implies that the teacher is Tom's mother, which is consistent with choice 0.

Question 81: Maria and Juliana went out for drinks together. They ordered the same drink. Juliana was really thirsty and finished five in the time it took Maria to finish one. The drinks were poisoned, but only Maria died. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice for the question "How did only Maria die?" would be choice 2: "The poison was in the ice." This choice aligns with the scenario described, where both Maria and Juliana drank the same drink, but only Maria died. The fact that they ordered the same drink suggests that the difference in outcomes could be attributed to something added to the drink, such as the poison being in the ice.

Question 82: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?

Question 83: A man was dancing at a ball when he unintentionally swung his arm off a glass on the table; oddly, not a drop of wine leaked. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, choice 2 = Surface tension prevents wine from spilling is the best choice for the given scenario. Surface tension is a property of liquids that allows them to resist external forces, such as being spilled. In this case, it is possible that the surface tension of the wine in the glass prevented it from spilling when the man swung his arm off the glass.

Question 84: The brother of a beggar passed away, but the deceased had no brothers. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 3 = None of the above.

Question 85: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice based on commonsense reasoning would be 2 = He told Danny to let some air out of his tires. By letting some air out of the tires, the overall height of the semi would decrease, allowing it to have more clearance and potentially be removed from under the bridge.

Question 86: The coaches of the first and the fifth national basket ball champion shares the same parents, but were not brothers. How can this be possible?

Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the given question would be 3 - None of the above. Since the question explicitly states that there was nothing wrong with the ship and no storm occurred, choices 0, 1, and 2 can be logically ruled out. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that none of the above options caused the ship to sink.

Question 88: Morgan was making apricot jam. She put all the apricots in the pot and stirred them up. Then she remembered she had to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every two apricots! How did she figure out how much lemon juice to put?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 2 = She counted the pits of apricots. This choice aligns with the information given in the passage, where Morgan puts all the apricots in the pot and stirs them up, implying that she knows how many apricots she put in. By counting the pits, she can determine the number of apricots she used and therefore calculate the amount of lemon juice needed.

Question 89: All but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red, and all but one are blue. However, Mr. Brown only has two cars. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 2 = Mr. Brown has one red car and one blue car. Given that all but one of Mr. Brown's cars are red and all but one are blue, and considering that he only has two cars, it logically follows that one car is red and the other car is blue.

However, it is stated that Tom and Joe didn't pay, which means that the person who did pay is not mentioned in the answer choices.

Question 93: Joe and Sally were sitting in their family room one night. While Joe was watching T.V, his wife Sally was reading. All of a sudden the power went out and Joe decided to go to bed, but Sally kept on reading. With no use of artificial light, Sally kept on reading. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the given information, the best choice among the given options would be:

Choice 2 = Because it was daytime.

This choice is the most reasonable because it explains how Sally was able to continue reading without the use of artificial light. Since it mentions that "Joe and Sally were sitting in their family room one night" and "While Joe was watching T.V, his wife Sally was reading," it implies that it was still nighttime when the power went out. Therefore, the answer choice suggesting that it was daytime provides a logical explanation for how Sally could continue reading without artificial light.

Question 98: Danny was driving his semi under an overpass when suddenly he came to a screening halt. Danny wasn't paying enough attention and inadvertently drove under the overpass that was just barely as high as his truck. The semi was wedge so tightly that he could not go forward or backward. A fellow tracker came by and told him how he could easily get the semi out from under the bridge. What did he suggest?
Model Answer (Wrong): Using commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the question would be 2: He told Danny to let some air out of his tires. This is because if the truck is wedged tightly under the overpass, reducing the tire pressure would lower the overall height of the truck and allow it to be released from the obstruction.

Question 99: A chess team has five players, and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?

Question 103: Tom was arguing with his younger sister. Because of the fighting, their mother decided to have them stand on the same piece of newspaper so they couldn't touch each other as punishment. How did she manage to do this?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information provided, the best choice would be 2 = Tom's mother slid a newspaper under a door, each sibling standing on each side.

This choice is the most logical because it effectively prevents Tom and his younger sister from touching each other by placing them on opposite sides of the newspaper, which is placed under a door. This way, they are physically separated and cannot physically interact with each other.

Question 104: A man buys a rope from a woman for $3.00 and hands the woman a $10 bill. The woman goes into the grocery store next door to get change. She returns and gives the man $7.00.

Model Answer (Wrong): Using commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the question would be Option 3: None of the above. The woman did not lose any money in this scenario. She sold the rope for $3 and received $10 in return from the man. She then exchanged the $10 bill for change at the grocery store, which she later gave to the man ($7). Although the woman received a counterfeit bill from the man, she ultimately did not suffer any loss as she was able to exchange it for a good bill from the store clerk.

Question 105: A man who lived on the top floor of a twenty story building had to go up and down daily for work, and of course, for food and the other necessities. On most days he could only ride the elevator to the fifteenth story, and he would have to walk the rest of the way. When it rained, however, he could ride all the way up to the twentieth story. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice for the question is 0 = During rainy weather, the elevator was programmed to automatically bypass certain floors above the fifteenth story. This choice aligns with the information provided in the question statement that on most days, the man could only ride the elevator to the fifteenth story and had to walk the rest of the way. However, when it rained, he could ride all the way up to the twentieth story, suggesting that the elevator bypassed certain floors during rainy weather.

Question 106: Apricot Jam was being made by Morgan. She stirred the apricots in the pot after adding them all. It was then that she realized she needed to add 1 ounce of lemon juice for every 2 apricots! How did she calculate the appropriate amount of lemon juice?

This suggests that she had a specific count of apricots that she added to the pot. To calculate the appropriate amount of lemon juice, she would need to know the exact number of apricots, which could be determined by counting the apricot pits.

Question 107: Friday, Jason and Kobe go to a restaurant for dinner. The waiter gave three sets of knives and forks to their table. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on the information given, the best choice for the question would be:

Choice: 1 = Friday is also the name of one person, there are three people in total.

Question 118: A full water glass was in the hands of the magician. Without spilling a single drop of water, he held the glass above his head and allowed it to fall to the carpet. How did he accomplish dropping the glass from a height of six feet without any water spilling?
Model Answer (Wrong): Based on commonsense reasoning, the best choice for the question is: 2 = The glass was filled, but not with water. Since the question states that the glass was full, but no water spilled when it was dropped, it implies that the glass was not filled with water. Therefore, choice 2 is the most logical option.

Question 119: Which could see the best in complete darkness? a tiger, a bat, or an owl.
Model Answer (Wrong): The best choice would be 2 = Owl. Owls are known for their exceptional night vision and their ability to see and hunt in complete darkness.
