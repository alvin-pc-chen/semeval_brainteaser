System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen?
                Choices: 0 = His hair is dyed.; 1 = This man is bald.; 2 = This man walk upside down to avoid rain.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Samuel got wet from the rain, but no hair on his head got wet. If Samuel dyed his hair or walked upside down it would still be wet. Samuel is bald, so his hair didn't get wet. The answer is 1
                Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Rope generally cannot stretch, and if it could stretch the length would be variable. If the walls collapse, the horse would be further from the hay. The rope not being tied to anything else is the simplest answer. The answer is 1
                Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time, even if her husband is bad. If the woman did not get divorced or legally separated, she cannot be legally married to more than one person. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?
                Choices: 0 = Old money weight more than new money.; 1 = Old money is dirtier than new money.; 2 = Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The weight and dirtiness of money doesn't affect its value. 1968 and 1967 refer to the number of pennies. The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies. The answer is 2
                Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come?
                Choices: 0 = The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 1 = The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 2 = The teacher was in an orphanage school.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even if the teacher had informed all the parents or all the students in advance about the unique disciplinary approach, it is unlikely that nobody would object. If the teacher is in an orphange school, there would be no parents to object. The answer is 2
                Question: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?
                Choices: 0 = Home.; 1 = The way to the pond.; 2 = Pond.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them are lost, 27 - 5 = 22. Thirteen of them are staying home, 22 - 13 = 9. Nine of them are at the pond, 9 - 9 = 0. There are no more ducks so the question is invalid. The answer is 3
                Question: How many birth days does the average person have?
                Choices: 0 = People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.; 1 = They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.; 2 = It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: People celebrate birthdays annually, but that's different from their birth day. Nobody has zero birth days since they have to be born. Everyone is born only once so technically the average person has one birthday in their lifetime. The answer is 1
                Question: The more you take, the more you leave behind
                Choices: 0 = Love.; 1 = Footsteps.; 2 = Money.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Love and money don't increase by taking them, they decrease. The more you walk, the more footsteps you leave behind. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question isn't about the character or behavior of the two farmers. It's about their relationship. Only the first answer choice provides a plausible relationship between the two farmers. It says 'Son' implying that one of the farmer's parents is lazy, and this farmer is not his father which lets us conclude that the lazy farmer is his mother. The answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were sleeping and scared by the sound of track or if the rumble of the train moved the shelf which crushed them, there would be evidence of a physical trauma. The presence of shattered glass and water on the floor suggests that they were fish in a tank, the rumble of the train caused the tank to fall from the shelf, break, and they did not survive out of water. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): The day before your birthday, you are effectively the age you're currently at, which is one less than what you will become on your birthday. This is a scenario that happens every year before your birthday. The answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In the context of a sports team, there isn't mention of positions like first or second officer. If an assistant captain leaves, the position of team captain wouldn't generally be affected. It falls to the captain to lead the team regardless of the assistant captain's status. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): Persons with unlisted numbers won't be included in the directory. Thus, if you pick 100 names at random from the directory, it implies that all these 100 people have listed number. None of them will have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The unusual vision or big action of smiling would not realistically allow the guard to see his companion was smiling. If the guards were facing each other, even though looking in opposite directions, they could see each other’s face. Hence, one guard could see the other was smiling. The answer is 0

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The height of the house or the jumping ability of the dog species is not the primary factor here. A house cannot jump at all. Therefore, even a small leap from the dog would easily surpass a house's "jumping" ability. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can divide 100 by 10 to get 10, but if you divide 10 again by 10 you get 1. If you continue dividing by 10, you will get decimals and even smaller fractions but strictly speaking, you can't get a whole number more than twice. So, the answer is 2.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question doesn't provide enough specific information. It doesn't specify how many criminals there are, the total population size, or the capabilities of the police. Therefore, it doesn't provide a logical way to determine how many more criminals the police can find. The answer is 3.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day fall in every year. Christmas falls on December 25th of the current year and New Year's Day falls on January 1st of the new year, but it is still part of the 12-month period we consider a year. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs, only hens do. Therefore, regardless of how often the farmer feeds the roosters, they will never produce eggs. The answer is 1.

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide evidence that the playground was strictly for football or that Mark only notices football players. It also doesn't provide evidence that Mark only considers football players as great players. The question doesn't provide enough information to determine how Mark knew who the person was that people got excited for. The answer is 3

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): Running fast or being lucky don't necessarily prevent someone from getting wet in the rain. As odd as it might sound, the only logical explanation could be that the man who stayed dry was in a coffin because it is mentioned that the men are at a church, which often hosts funerals. So the answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): The scenario doesn't imply that the woman became brave all of a sudden or tried to scare the bear. The most logical reason for her not to be afraid when she spotted the bear is because she is at a zoo where animals are usually tamed or contained. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man is a jumping athlete, without the assistance of a trampoline or pole, it's unlikely he could clear the distance between two separate houses. If one house was much higher than the other, the man would fall rather than fly. If two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other, it would be possible for the man to jump from one to the other. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the attorney had moved away or was angry, they would still technically have a brother. The only logical explanation is that the accountant is his sister. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the attorney is denying having a brother, but the accountant says the attorney is their brother, it indicates that the accountant must be a sister. The other explanations imply that someone is lying or not acknowledging family ties. The answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The son has nothing to do with the monetary splitting of the mothers and the daughters in this scenario. If the two daughters share $7, then the total given to the mothers and daughters combined would fall short of $21. However, if the group consists of one daughter, one mother (who is also a daughter), and one grandmother (who is also a mother), this forms a group of two daughters and two mothers, i.e., three individuals. These three can split $21 equally among them leading to each having $7. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If a man has 9 children and half of them are boys, this means all of them are boys because there's no way to split 9 children evenly. So, the correct answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): The doctor gave three medicines to be taken every half hour. Therefore, it can be represented as 0 min (first medicine), 30 min (second medicine), 60 min (third medicine). So, the drugs would be taken over the course of 1 hour. The answer is 2

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The height of the house or the jumping ability of the dog species would not naturally lead to the dog jumping higher than a house. However, the key to understanding this question is in the phrasing. The bet was that the dog could jump higher than a house, but houses can't jump. So, the dog wins by default. The answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): Walking on hands or stilts for a lengthy stroll around the park is not feasible. If the ground is not wet, even without rubber boots, the person's feet will still be dry. The answer is 0

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs, only hens do. So, it's not possible for the rooster to lay an egg. Thus, the egg would not roll off on any side of the barn because it doesn't exist. The answer is 1.

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If James was unhealthy, the bears would still likely approach him. Weather conditions like cold could impact bear's behavior, but it does not guarantee that they would just take a look and leave. The most logical explanation is that James was surrounded by bears at the zoo, where the bears could not attack him. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill right away, the second pill after half an hour, and the third pill after another half an hour, which makes an hour in total. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you subtract 10 from 100, you get 90. If you tried to subtract 10 from 100 again, it would be incorrect since 100 has been changed to 90 after the first subtraction. Therefore, you can deduct 10 from 100 only once. The answer is 0

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The girls answered truthfully that they were from the same family, had the same parents, and were born on the same day, but they are not twins. This could only be possible if they were triplets, or part of a larger multiple birth. The other answer choices are irrelevant. The answer is 0

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The sound of the track wouldn't cause death. If the shelf crushed them, there would likely be mention of a shelf on them. Romeo and Juliet are named, a hint that they may not be humans. If Romeo and Juliet are fish, the rumble from a passing train could have knocked their tank off a shelf. It broke, spilling water and causing them to die. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the vice coach cannot attend, it's logical that the main coach has responsibility for leading the team. Therefore, the answer is 0

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The gender of the doctor and lawyer do not factor into the policeman's decision. Nor does the relationship between the dead man and the other individuals. The policeman did not arrest the mail man based on the name "John", he would not be certain. The answer that would immediately suggest to the cop that the mail man was the perpetrator is 2 because it provides explicit information about the gender of the individuals. The only male in the room was the mail man. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): Older adults may need to modify their diet to manage chronic illness or to meet the needs of a changing metabolism, but it doesn't necessarily mean they consume more food than young people. Living longer doesn't equate to eating more food. Increased nutrient intake can lead to eating more nutrient-dense food, not necessarily more food. The answer is 3

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack being scared of the water or needing to go to the hospital doesn't necessarily lead to his death herein. If Jack was a fish, being out of the water would mean he could not breathe, leading to his death. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The gender of the dogs isn't specified in the question. The fat dog can't be the thin dog's father, but the fat dog could be the thin dog's mother. The answer is 2

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens do. The egg couldn't have rolled anywhere because it couldn't have existed in the first place. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being an excellent football player or lucky doesn't prevent someone from getting wet in the rain. Photographs aren't humans and can't stay dry by themselves. This doesn't make sense in the context. The answer is 3.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one mother gave her $7 to her son, then they wouldn't be splitting the money equally. The same with two daughters sharing $7, it doesn't fit. They can be one daughter (who is also a mother), one mother (who is also a daughter and a mother), and one grandmother (who is also a mother). This makes only three people, so they each get $7. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the phone numbers are unlisted, they wouldn't be in the phone directory. As such, you wouldn't be able to select those with unlisted phone numbers from the directory. Therefore, none of the people selected from the directory will have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): The first man didn't get wet because he was not alive. He was in a coffin, that's why he didn't get wet. It is unlikely that being lucky or being an athlete could prevent someone from getting wet in the rain. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, then there would only be two people which doesn't match "themselves". If each kid's parents pooled $10, that would suggest that there are more than four people. If Jack and Tom are brothers who share the same parents, then there would be four people. Each person would receive $10. The answer is 2.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of a sheep's wool does not inherently affect its appetite or dietary needs. The sheep's color absorbing more heat does not necessarily mean they'd eat less. The number of sheep of one color in the world can affect the total amount of food consumed by that color of sheep. If there are fewer black sheep than white sheep, white sheep would consume more food because there are more of them. The answer is 0.

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): Suddenly becoming brave or trying to scare the bear are risky and unlikely behaviours when spotting a bear. The most logical explanation is that the bear was enclosed or in a controlled environment where it couldn't harm her. If she spotted the bear at a zoo, she would be safe. The answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): Since it's highly unlikely that John can see into the future, option 0 doesn't seem reasonable. Option 2 suggests a motive on Tom's part, but it doesn't explain how John could correctly predict the outcome. Option 3 nullifies any explanation. That leaves us with option 1, John said the score would be 0-0 "before" any football game starts, and he was correct. The answer is 1.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The only logical reason that Tom lost the bet was because John correctly predicted the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. An ability to see into the future is unrealistic, and Tom's kindness isn't relevant to the bet. The only logical explanation that John could always be correct before a basketball game starts is if he bet that the score would be 0-0, because before any game starts, the score is always 0-0. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sports team, the role of leadership generally falls to the captain. The Assistant Captain's duty is often to assist the Captain. If the Assistant Captain were to resign, the responsibility would still be with the Captain. The answer is 0

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): When you subtract 10 from 100, you're left with 90. The next number you're working with is 90, not 100. Therefore, you can only subtract 10 from 100 once. The answer is 2

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that half of the 11 sheep are white, which could be true if there are colorful or mix-breed sheep on the farm. Despite this, it's strange for half of 11, an odd number, to be white. The description would make more sense if all the sheep were white. Therefore, the correct choice is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement that the officer doesn't have a brother anymore could be because he never had one to begin with, implying the officer could be a woman. So, the officer being James's sister who does not have a brother anymore (since James was arrested) makes the story possible. The answer is 2

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the kids were boys, then males wouldn't make up half of them, they would make up all of them. The children being raised in both boy way and girl way does not change their genders. None of the options are correct. The question itself seems to have a flaw or not enough context, the correct answer might be that half of his kids are boys and the other half are girls, but this option is not given. So the answer is 3

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The boys live in the same house, have the same parents, and were born on the same date, but they aren't twins. They could be triplets or part of a larger set of multiple births. Raising them differently or one boy not being loved by their family has no relevance to whether they're twins or not. The answer is 0

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the third man was walking on his hands, his hands would be wet. The ground not being wet and the man walking on stilts would keep all three men dry, but only the last one explains the situation of the third man alone. The answer is 1.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Predicting the future is impossible, and kindness does not imply that Tom lost the bet. Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. John simply stated the obvious and won the bet. The answer is 0.

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question implies that the cop was not present during the shooting and had no direct evidence or testimony to guide him. Therefore, the cop couldn't identify the man based on his profession, name or relationship with the others. However, the scenario indicates that the cop did arrest a man. Considering that the doctor and the lawyer were females as evidenced in Choice 0, the only person left was the 'mail man' (assuming no typographical error and it means 'man' not 'Milan'), who must be the one referred to as "John". The answer is 0.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that the driver is told to make a stop every half an hour. However, it doesn't specify how long each stop is. Therefore, the duration of the stops cannot be determined from the information given, so the answer is 3.

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fish tank being in a ring shape would allow the two fishes to see each other even while swimming in the opposite directions, as the fish would just swim around in a circle and keep passing each other. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of a sheep's wool does not change its eating habits based on heat absorption or their need for food. The quantity of food a sheep eats is not dependent on it's color but on its size, age, and health. If there are fewer black sheep than white sheep worldwide, then collectively all black sheep would eat less than all white sheep. The answer is 2.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the girls aren't identical twins, but they look alike, share parents, and share a birthday, it suggests there is another sibling involved. Therefore, the girls are likely triplets, or perhaps part of a larger multiple birth. This meets all the criteria. The other options do not logically meet the details given in the question. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The ground being not wet is inconsistent with the statement of a lush and muddy meadow. Walking on hands would make his hands wet. The third man can have dry feet in a wet meadow if he's walking on stilts that elevate his feet above the wet ground. The answer is 1

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog being thin when it is father doesn't change the fact that it is the father. It's already stated that the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog, so its food habits do not apply. The fat dog could be the mother of the thin dog, as not being the father does not rule out being the mother. The answer is 1

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards are looking in opposite directions so if they were back to back, they couldn't see each other's faces. Unusual vision is unlikely and irrelevant, and it is not mentioned that any of the guards made big actions to see each other. If the guards were facing each other, they could see each other's smiles. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. Christmas Day is at the end of the year and New Year's Day is at the beginning of the next year. The answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of the shirt depends on the color of the wet stone it is put on. Yellowstone refers to a national park and does not indicate a specific color. Therefore, none of the options logically follows. The answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): Similarly to a previous question, a rope or metal cannot usually stretch, and the idea of the Lion digging a tunnel to reach the human is unlikely. So, the simplest answer is that the other end of the rope or metal is not tied to anything, allowing the Lion to move freely. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of legs by counting the animals' legs would provide an inaccurate total not considering creatures with different amount of legs. However, the question asks for the legs on the ground. Your legs are on the ground, and the bed's legs are also on the ground. Animals' legs are on the bed, not the ground. So, there are six legs on the ground altogether. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): A fall from a 20-story building is generally fatal, so the woman being strong enough or the fireman reaching her in time are unlikely explanations. It was stated that there was nothing below her except the fall so the only possible place for her to fall without getting seriously injured would be back into her apartment. So, the answer is 1.

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman doesn't typically maintain a beard. A superstar might maintain a beard or shave frequently due to appearances but it's not pertinent to their identity. A barber could shave three times a day or more, but these shavings would be for the clients and not for themselves. Hence, the barber could maintain a beard. The answer is 1.

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is about not cracking the egg on a concrete floor, and not about whether the concrete floor is hard to crack. Dropping the egg gently or hard will likely result in it cracking. Therefore, the choice 'No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack' is logically entailed. The answer is 2.

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man is smart, pretending to read is different from actually reading. A blind man can read in the dark using braille. Daylight doesn't matter if the man is in a house with no lights on at all and no other light source. The answer is 2

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of a tractor falling into hail or being floated over a lake are unrealistic scenarios, and the prompt clearly states it was not built on the island. The tractor could reasonably have been driven over the lake during winter when it was frozen. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, the history teacher or the English teacher wouldn't be able to understand the test even with the help of a friend or translator. However, since numbers are the same in all languages, the math teacher would be able to understand Sally's work. The answer is 2

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man's ride out and back into town cannot change the day of the week. A national holiday the next week isn't related to his ride. However, his horse could be named Sunday. This means he rode out on Friday, but he rode back into town on his horse, Sunday. The answer is 0.

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a fragile glass ball hard or gently against a brick wall will most likely shatter it, and the sturdiness of the brick doesn't impact whether the glass shatters. None of the provided choices entail a way to toss a glass ball against a brick wall without shattering it. The answer is 3.

Question 72: Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Lisa is Emily's daughter, that would align with the fact that Lisa is William's niece and Emily being William's sister. Adoption or half-sibling relationships would not change the familial status of nieces or daughters. The answer is 0.

Question 73: In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not mention the priority given by the cops or the value of the items in the rooms. Since the police do not put out fires, this is a job for firefighters, not the police. Therefore, the answer is 3

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the history teacher has a good friend from France, this does not automatically mean he can understand French. The English teacher's experience with translators does not guarantee she can understand the French language. The math teacher can understand the exam because numbers are universally the same and do not need translation. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man received medical attention, jumping from a 50-story building would cause injury. The height of the man doesn't affect the height of the building. He won't get hurt if he jumps from the ground floor. The answer is 1.

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the boy was on the first step, a fall wouldn't cause much damage because of the short distance to the ground. Medical attention wouldn't necessarily prevent getting hurt. The ladder height is not relative to the boy's height but the distance he falls. The answer is 2.

Question 77: You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Vietnam is a coastal country and the phenomenon of tides is common. Tides cause the sea level to rise and fall. When the sea level rises, the boats float and when the sea level falls, the boats become grounded. The Answer is 0.

Question 78: He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A businessman or a writer would likely have written words at some point. A publisher may have many books to their credit, but they do not write the content, they only publish the books. The answer is 1.

Question 79: In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man reading without any light source suggests he is blind and reading braille. He would not be able to see a book to pretend to read it in the dark. It could not be daytime because it was stated the man was reading at night. The answer is 1

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): In reality, dolphins don't untie boats from docks and waves being powerful wouldn't cause the boat to untie itself. The boat could be in the middle of the ocean only if the station wasn't properly fixed. So, the answer is 0

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping an egg gently or hard against a hard rock wall won't prevent it from breaking. Concrete floors' hardness is irrelevant to the egg not breaking. If you don't throw the egg, it won't break. There is no answer choice that matches this, so the answer is 3.

Question 82: You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The situation where all people on the boat jump into the sea or hide themselves in a moment seems unlikely. The phrase "you don't see a single person on the boat" may refer to their relationship status rather than their presence. Hence, 'single' refers to the relationship status. The answer is 2

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of a shirt doesn't change depending on the color of the water. It doesn't turn green just because of previous stated facts, and if it was white initially, it doesn't remain white. Throwing it into Red Sea also doesn't turn it red. Therefore, none of the options correctly answer the question. The answer is 3.

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the coffee shops and his home were on a slope, it would mean he has to walk uphill either to work or from work. The distance from the first coffee shop to his house and from the second coffee shop to his house is consistent with stopping at the first in the morning and the second in the evening. Therefore, the claim that either coffee shop is too far away does not stand. The best answer is "None of above" considering the given choices. So the answer is 3.

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?
Model Answer (Wrong): The restaurant being big or the relationship status of the clientele doesn't impact table availability. If all the people left the restaurant in a moment, their tables would be free. It's possible the tables are booked but the people haven't arrived yet. So none of the given choices logically explains why a restaurant would be devoid of diners despite claiming to be fully booked. The answer is 3

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if he got medical attention, falling off a 100-foot ladder would harm him. The height of the ladder does not change depending on the person. If he was only on the first step, falling off wouldn't harm him because it's not a far fall. The answer is 1

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question statement states that "Mary's father has five children." It then proceeded by naming four of them - Nana, None, Nine and Non. It's implied in the question that the fifth one is Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question doesn't provide enough information for us to determine which room the policemen would prioritize. But, logically speaking, policemen don't put out fires, that's the job of firemen. Therefore, none of the options provided matches with the reasoning. The answer is 3.

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): Given that the total distance run over 5 days is 70 km, and that each day he ran 2 km more than the previous day, we can build an arithmetic progression. If he started with a certain distance on the first day, on the second day he would run this distance + 2km, on the third day this distance + 4km, on the fourth day this distance + 6km, and on the fifth day this distance + 8km. 

When we sum all these distances, we must get a total of 70 km:

5*initial distance + 2*(1+2+3+4) = 70;

We can solve this equation to find the initial distance which is represented in kilometers. The answer is 1.

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The possibilities mentioned in choices 0 and 1 are very unlikely and the tractor would not be able to be assembled if the parts were damaged while falling or floating on the lake. In cold climates, lakes can freeze solid enough to drive over them. Thus the tractor could have been transported over the lake in winter. The answer is 2.

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): Let's work with the information that the fisherman caught three more fish each day than the day before. If we assume the number of fish he caught on the first day is X, then the sequence of fish he caught over the five days will look like this: X, X+3, X+6, X+9, X+12. Now according to the question, the total number of fish he caught over the five days is 30. Therefore, we add the series together: X + (X+3) + (X+6) + (X+9) + (X+12) = 30, which simplifies to 5X + 30 = 30. Solving this equation gives X = 1, so the fisherman caught one fish on the first day. The answer is 1.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew, it means that the nephew is related to Tony but not Jack. This is possible if the nephew is Jack's son. So, the answer is 0.

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question asks what would happen if one bird on the fence is shot. While logically one might think that one bird will be removed leaving nine, it does not take into account the scare which will occur when the bird is shot. The sound of the gunshot will scare the rest of the birds away, so none will be left on the fence. The answer is 3.

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being a superstar or finishing the dish without waste doesn't necessarily exempt someone from paying for their meal at a restaurant. If he works at the restaurant, it's possible that he gets meals as part of his compensation. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The marriage or movement of family members does not change the number of Mrs. Jones' biological children. All four daughters could share the same brother. This means Mrs. Jones has five children - four daughters and one son. The answer is 2.

Question 96: You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is emphasizing the presence of five "organization heads" which implies these are people leading an organization. Considering this, there would be five heads in the room. The answer is 1.

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): A man leaving town and returning on the same weekday isn't likely unless the weekday is the name of something else. In this case, the name of his horse is Sunday, so he left and returned on his horse named Sunday. The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The distances are stated, and none of them are too far. If his home and the stations were located on a hill, it wouldn't impact his boarding and exiting habit. However, the fact that the student always boards at the first stop and exits at the second stop indicates that this is the best route for him to follow. The information about leaning forward while riding his scooter and the fact that he always boards at the first stop (downhill) and always exits at the second stop (uphill), suggests that the areas between his home and the train stations are on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter in the morning and either walk or ride up the hill in the evening. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of participants implies the count of players and coaches is six. This could not be possible if each player had a unique coach as that would result in more participants. If the players share a single coach, the sum would be six (five players and one coach). So, the answer is 0.

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if Emily is adopted or doesn't share the same mother with William, Lisa would still be her niece if Lisa is William's niece. If Lisa is Emily's daughter, then she cannot be William's niece. At the same time, nothing in the question indicates that Emily has a daughter. The information provided does not justify any of the presented choices. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The distance to the train stops isn't specified as a problem, and either direction isn't too far away. If the stations and his home are situated on a hill, it would be easier for him to ride down on his scooter. The answer is 1

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?
Model Answer (Wrong): Firemen do not have the authority to make arrests regardless of the situation. Their primary role is fighting fires and providing emergency services. Arresting people is the responsibility of the police. The answer is 3

Question 103: If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The rope generally doesn't stretch, and even if the dog dug a tunnel, the rope's length would restrict it. If the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, the dog will be free to explore further. The answer is 0.

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it were daytime, it wouldn't be completely dark. If Jessica were pretending to read, her parents wouldn't reward her constantly. Jessica is blind and reads using braille, which doesn't require light. The answer is 2

Question 105: A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Whether there is a national holiday next week or the hotel room is expensive does not explain how the man could leave and return to town on a Sunday. However, if his horse is named Sunday, then he rode out of town on 'Sunday' (his horse) and returned on 'Sunday' as well. The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Amy cannot reach the ground from the 17th floor in a second. The dog is unlikely to be unharmed from falling from the 17th floor, regardless of how strong he is. If the dog fell back into Amy's apartment from the balcony, he wouldn't be harmed. The answer is 2.

Question 107: Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You shoot one. How many are there left?
Model Answer (Wrong): When a gun is fired, the loud sound usually scares birds away. So, after shooting, all the birds would likely fly away. Therefore, there would be no birds left on the fence. The answer is 3

Question 108: He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A lawyer or a teacher doesn't marry people as part of their job. A preacher or minister often performs the ceremony for weddings, so he may have married many women but hasn't necessarily been married himself. The answer is 1.

Question 109: Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names. What is the name of the fifth child?
Model Answer (Wrong): The beginning of the question states "Mary's father is the father of five children," this implies that Mary is one of the five children. The other four children are named Nana, None, Nine, and Non. Therefore, the fifth child's name is Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 110: Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?
Model Answer (Wrong): Ana's school has 4 students in total, and we know the names of Maria, James, and Jonghyun. That leaves us one student, and Ana is the only name left that we haven't accounted for. The answer is 1

Question 111: A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a bruise. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): A 20-story fall would likely cause more than just a bruise, so the woman's strength isn't the answer. Firemen can't run 100 yards in a second, so the fireman being in excellent shape doesn't explain why the woman was not hurt. The simplest answer is that the woman fell back into her apartment. So, the answer is 1.

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman typically doesn't grow a beard. A superstar could potentially shave three times a day and still grow a beard, but it's not directly related to them being a superstar. A barber shaves other people's beards, not their own. The answer is 1.

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Without having learned English, it would be difficult for the students to use translation tools or guess the answers to an English assignment. However, as a Math teacher, even if the instructions are in English, the numbers are universal. The students will be able to understand the assignment. The answer is 1.

Question 114: If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea doesn't change its color. Neither the sea paint objects red nor it turns them green. So, the shirt would remain white. The answer is 2.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the people jumped into the sea or hid, there would be a logical explanation, but it would be practically impossible to happen in a moment. The phrase "not a single person on the boat" is playing on the word "single." If all the people on the boat are in relationships, there is not a "single" person on the boat. So, the answer is 2.

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you add up the number of fish caught over five days with each day having three more fish than the previous day, the first day's amount is 2 fish.

Day 1: 2 fish
Day 2: 5 fish
Day 3: 8 fish
Day 4: 11 fish
Day 5: 14 fish

Total: 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 = 40 fish. This does not align with the 30 fish caught during the tournament. Based on the given options, none provide a valid start for a sequence to reflect a total of 30 fish over five days. The answer is 3.

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the internet was disconnected, Bob wouldn't be able to search anything on Google, regardless of whether he was a member, or if he searched in a wrong way. So, the reason is because the internet was disconnected. The answer is 2.

Question 118: He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?
Model Answer (Wrong): A teacher or a lawyer would not typically wed multiple women, so both these options are likely incorrect. A preacher, however, often conducts wedding ceremonies, which could be interpreted as him 'marrying' numerous women, without getting married himself. The answer is 1.

Question 119: You walk into a room and see a bed and lie on it. On the bed, there are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose. There are also three doves flying above the bed. How many legs are on the floor?
Model Answer (Wrong): The animals and the flying birds wouldn't have their legs on the floor if they are on the bed or flying. The only ones with legs on the floor would be the bed and you. A bed generally has four legs and you have two. The answer is 1

Question 120: Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Mrs. Jones has four daughters, and she has a brother for each daughter, implying she has one son. The children don't need to get married or move away. Each daughter shares the same brother, meaning Mrs. Jones has five children: four daughters and one son. The answer is 2.
