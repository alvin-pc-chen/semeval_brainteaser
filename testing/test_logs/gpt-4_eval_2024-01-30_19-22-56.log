System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: Samuel was out for a walk when it started to rain. He did not have an umbrella and he wasn't wearing a hat. His clothes were soaked, yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How could this happen?
                Choices: 0 = His hair is dyed.; 1 = This man is bald.; 2 = This man walk upside down to avoid rain.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Samuel got wet from the rain, but no hair on his head got wet. If Samuel dyed his hair it would still be wet. Samuel is bald, so his hair didn't get wet. The answer is 1
                Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: That the rope is not tied to anything else is the simplest choice. The horse can reach the hay whenever he chooses. The answer is 1
                Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time. If the woman did not get divorced or legally separated, she cannot be legally married to more than one person. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?
                Choices: 0 = Old money weight more than new money.; 1 = Old money is dirtier than new money.; 2 = Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: 1968 and 1967 refer to the number of pennies. The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies. The answer is 2
                Question: Not a single parent objected when the teacher spanked every child in the class. How come?
                Choices: 0 = The teacher had informed all the parents in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 1 = The teacher had informed all the children in advance about the unique disciplinary approach.; 2 = The teacher was in an orphanage school.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even if the teacher had informed all the parents or all the students in advance about the unique disciplinary approach, it is unlikely that nobody would object. If the teacher is in an orphange school, there would be no parents to object. The answer is 2
                Question: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them got lost, thirteen of them are staying home, and nine of them are at the pond. Where are the rest of them?
                Choices: 0 = Home.; 1 = The way to the pond.; 2 = Pond.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Twenty-seven ducks are going to the pond. Five of them are lost, 27 - 5 = 22. Thirteen of them are staying home, 22 - 13 = 9. Nine of them are at the pond, 9 - 9 = 0. There are no more ducks so the question is invalid. The answer is 3
                Question: How many birth days does the average person have?
                Choices: 0 = People may celebrate their birthdays annually, so it depends on their life span.; 1 = They technically only have one birth day in their lifetime.; 2 = It can be zero as some people are too busy to celebrating their birthdays.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Everyone is born only once so technically the average person has one birthday in their lifetime. The answer is 1
                Question: The more you take, the more you leave behind
                Choices: 0 = Love.; 1 = Footsteps.; 2 = Money.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Footsteps. The more you walk, the more footsteps you leave behind. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father. Since this is possible, the lazy farmer must be his mother. The answer is 0

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Romeo and Juliet are found with glass shards and water, suggesting their container was made of glass and filled with water. None of the other options explain this detail sufficiently. Thus, the answer is 2, supporting the theory that Romeo and Juliet are fish and their tank was knocked off a shelf.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): In this case, the logical response would be every year. As it implies that on your birthday you age a year, so the day before your birthday, you're a year younger than you will be tomorrow. The answer is 2

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if an assistant captain leaves, the captain of the team would not change, therefore, the team's captain would serve as a captain. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted numbers wouldn't be in the phone directory, so none of the 100 names selected would have an unlisted number. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards were not back to back but were actually looking at each other. This is how one knew that the other was smiling. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): A house cannot jump. So by default the dog jumps higher than the house. The answer is 0

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can divide 100 by 10 once to get the result 10. Any further divisions will not result in whole numbers. Therefore, you can divide 100 by 10 once. The answer is 1.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide enough information to answer how many more criminals the police can find. Therefore, the correct answer is 3, none of the above.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day fall in every year. New Year's Day is at the start of each year and Christmas is towards the end. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male chickens and they do not produce eggs. Therefore, regardless of how much food the farmer gives, they will not lay any eggs. The answer is 1

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the options accurately explain how Mark knew who the exciting player was. The setup does not provide information on how Mark recognized the specific player everyone was excited about. The answer is 3

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): The men were at a funeral and the one man who didn't get wet was the one in the coffin. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the woman was at the zoo, she would be safe from the bear due to the animal enclosures and would not need to be afraid. Thus, the answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not specify the distance between the houses. If the two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other, the man would not need to jump far to win the bet. The answer is 1

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The attorney is the brother of the accountant. However, the attorney testified he did not have a brother. If the accountant is his sister, then their statements would be true. The answer is 1

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant can be the sister of the attorney. Neither of the two options involving the attorney denying his brother or being estranged from family aligns with the statement "No one is lying." The answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): In the scenario, there are two mothers and two daughters. But they could also be one daughter, one mother, and one grandmother. The daughter is the mother's daughter, and the mother is the daughter of the grandmother. Thus, they can divide $21 equally amongst themselves. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): All the children are boys. So, half of them are boys, and the other half are also boys. The answer is 2

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you took three medicines every half hour, you would have taken all of them in one hour. The first at 0 minutes, the second at 30 minutes, and the third at 60 minutes. So, the answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Houses can't jump. The bet was that the dog could jump higher than a house, but since houses can't jump, any minimal jump the dog makes already makes it win the bet. The answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the student doesn't bring his rubber boots and still has dry feet, it could imply that the ground is not wet in the first place. Hence, his feet did not get wet despite the lack of rubber boots. The answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs. It is a biological fact. Therefore, the egg couldn't have rolled anywhere. The answer is 1.

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If James was surrounded by several hungry bears that just took a look and left, it implies that there must be some barrier. If James was at the zoo, the bears could approach and look but not touch him. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill immediately, the second pill after half an hour, and the third pill after another half hour. So, the pills last for one hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Once you deduct 10 from 100, it leaves 90. Henceforth, one will not be deducting 10 from 100, rather it will be 10 from 90, and then 10 from 80, etc. Therefore, you can only deduct 10 from 100 once. The answer is 0.

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The two girls look exactly the same and answered "yes" when asked if they were from the same family, have the same parents, and were born on the same day, but they are not twins. The only plausible explanation is that they were triplets (or part of a larger multiple birth). The answer is 0

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The presence of water and broken glass on the floor suggests that Romeo and Juliet were most likely fish. More than likely the rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, and when it shattered Romeo and Juliet were unable to survive. The answer is 2

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): In most cases, if the vice coach is unable to attend a game, the coach would be the individual to lead the team. The answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The policeman did not have enough information to make any assumptions about the kinship between the dead man and the doctor or lawyer. He also did not have information about whether the doctor or the lawyer would or wouldn't have the name John. The policeman knew instantly it was the mail man because the mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): None of these statements are universally true. Older adults usually require fewer calories due to the physical decline. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jack is a fish in the ocean. If a wave knocked him out of the water, he would not be able to breathe and would die within minutes. The answer is 2

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fat dog is not the thin dog's father, it may be the mother. The fat dog being the little dog's parent but not its father implies that the fat dog could be its mother. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs, only hens do. So the rooster didn't lay an egg, hence it didn't roll down either side. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The choices do not directly provide an answer that clearly explains why the person who did not move stayed dry during the sudden shower. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): They are one daughter, one mother and one grandmother. This makes a total of three people. Each person would receive $7. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): The phone directory only includes listed phone numbers. Therefore, someone with an unlisted number wouldn't be in the directory. So the answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man who stayed dry was in a coffin. The other men at his funeral got wet from the rain. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, they would each have $20. If each kid's parents pooled $10 for division, each person would end up with $5. Given that Jack and Tom are brothers and they share the same parents, only four people are considered in the division. Hence, each person would receive $10 under this scenario. The answer is 2.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): All sheep require food. Color does not indicate the amount of food that sheep eat. However, if the population of white sheep is higher than that of black sheep, then white sheep would consume more food. The answer is 0.

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): If a woman runs in excitement toward a bear, she's not likely to be in a dangerous situation with a wild bear, but rather at a safe distance from it, such as being in a zoo where bears are caged or thoroughly separated from visitors. The answer is 1

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. "Before" any football game starts, the score is always 0-0 which is a factual statement. The answer is 1.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John placed a bet that the score would be 0-0 before the game began, which is correct because this is the score before any basketball game starts. The bet was won because of this, meaning Tom lost. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The captain would lead the team because they are the most senior team member. The assistant captain assists the captain, but if the assistant resigns, the main captain remains in charge. The answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Once you subtract 10 from 100, it is no longer 100. Therefore, you can only subtract 10 from 100 once. The answer is 2

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Half of 11 is 5.5, and a sheep cannot be .5, they must be whole. However, if all the sheep are white, no matter how many he has, half of them would be white. So the answer is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The officer was a sister of James which makes sense because she said she does not have a brother anymore and James also didn't have a brother. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If half of the nine children are males, this implies that the other half are females. This could only be possible if all of them are boys. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to inquiries about living in the same house, having the same parents, and being born on the same date but also truthfully claimed they weren't twins. The only possible explanation is they were triplets or part of a larger set of multiples. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The information given is that only two men are wearing rubber boots and the third man's feet are dry. The reason given that the ground is dry makes sense as to why the man's feet remain dry, but this does not explain the necessity of the other two men wearing boots. The explanation that the third man is walking on stilts allows for the man's feet to remain dry, with the prerequisite condition that the ground could be wet, explaining the boots on the other two men. The answer is 1.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. John predicted the score accurately. The answer is 0.

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): Since the policeman was not present when the shooting took place and there was no obvious evidence to identify the shooter, we must look for a clue in the available choices. The statement "No John, not the gun!" implies that the shooter is someone named John, as the policeman could have inferred. From the given options, it's stated that the mailman was the only male. If the doctor and lawyer were women, the only possible "John" would have to be the mailman. So, the answer is 0.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The driver is told to make a stop five times. If each stop is half an hour, then 5 stops * 0.5 hours/stop = 2.5 hours. The answer is 1

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fish tank is shaped like a ring or circle, the fishes would be able to swim continually and see each other every few minutes despite swimming in opposite directions. The answer is 1

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not specify that all sheep have the same feeding habits. Since there are fewer black sheep in the world than white ones, the total amount of food consumed by black sheep would indeed be less than that consumed by white sheep. The answer is 2.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The girls have the same appearance and shared the same birthday, but are not identical twins. The only option that would explain this is choice 0. The girls could be triplets, or part of a larger multiple birth, but still have the same birthday and a similar appearance. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The information given does not suggest that the ground is not wet or that the third man is walking on his hands or stilts to keep his feet dry. Instead, it is possible for the third man's feet to be dry if he is one of the two men wearing rubber boots. Hence, none of the given choices logically explain the situation and the answer is 3.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement suggests that the fat dog is a parent of the thin dog, but not the father, meaning the fat dog must be the mother. The answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards were not back to back. They were facing each other, thus one could see the other's face and tell he was smiling. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. Christmas Day is on December 25 and New Year's Day is on January 1 of the following year. The answer is 1

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): Yellowstone is a name, not a color or physical attribute. Thus, the color of the shirt wouldn't be influenced by the name of the place. Hence, the answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The other end of the metal is not tied at all. Thus, enabling the lion to reach a human 7m away. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question mentions that you walk into a room and lie down on the bed, implying that your legs and the legs of the bed are on the ground. As for the animals, it does not mention their position; consequently, the legs of the animals aren't considered. Therefore, there are six legs on the ground. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The woman jumped, but she jumped from the balcony into her apartment, not from the balcony to the ground. This is the only choice that explains why she was not hurt by a fall from a great height. The answer is 1.

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A barber. The barber shaves other people's beards, not their own. The answer is 1

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is about how not to crack a concrete floor by dropping a raw egg onto it. Concrete is a tough material, it's very unlikely that dropping a raw egg onto it will crack the floor. The answer is 2

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all.
