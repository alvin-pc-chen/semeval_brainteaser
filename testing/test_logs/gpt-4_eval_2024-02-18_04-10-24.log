System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: That the rope is not tied to anything else is the simplest choice. The horse can reach the hay whenever he chooses. The answer is 1
                Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time. If the woman did not get divorced or legally separated, she cannot be legally married to more than one person. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?
                Choices: 0 = Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.; 1 = The ground outside the building is wet.; 2 = Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even very strong men would not survive a fall from a 22-story building. The ground outside the building being wet would not cushion his fall. Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside. The answer is 0
                Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend?
                Choices: 0 = He told Danny to left the bridge.; 1 = He told Danny to overturn the track.; 2 = He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The bridge would not be lifted. Overturning the truck would not help. Letting some air out of his tires would help. The answer is 2
                Question: Why is the value of 1968 pennies higher than 1967 pennies?
                Choices: 0 = Old money weight more than new money.; 1 = Old money is dirtier than new money.; 2 = Because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: 1968 and 1967 refer to the number of pennies not that some are older and some are newer. The value of 1968 pennies is higher than 1967 pennies because there is one more penny in 1968 pennies than in 1967 pennies. The answer is 2
                Question: Each of the 30 participants in the masquerade had to wear a unique hat to distinguish themselves from one another. The host, however, only tallied 29 when he counted the number of hats to determine attendance. All 30 persons had signed their names on the spreadsheet, which confused him. He repeated the count. There are still 29. How is that even doable?
                Choices: 0 = One person had a pretty beautiful hat.; 1 = The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it.; 2 = One person had moved away from the group when the host was counting.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If one person had a pretty beautiful hat, then the host would still count 30 hats. If one person had moved away from the group when the host was counting, then the host would still count 30 hats. The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it. The answer is 1
                Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.; 1 = The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.; 2 = The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Dinosaurs are no longer alive, so they cannot live happily. Butterflies can give birth to offspring, so they are not the answer. Mules are born sterile, so they cannot give birth to offspring. The answer is 2
                Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The 6th woman beated them at the end.; 1 = The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.; 2 = The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If the sixth woman beat them or walked slowly to dodge the snow she would not have reached the cabin at the same time. If the sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying, then she would not be cold and would not have to hurry. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): One can conclude that the hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, yet the lazy farmer isn't the father because the lazy farmer is actually his mother. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The sound of the track would not kill them. The shelf crushing them would need a train collision, but that's not mentioned. Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): The day before your birthday, you are technically one year younger than you will be the next day, which is your birthday. This happens every year, not just in leap years or the first year of graduation. The answer is 2

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sports team, if an assistant captain leaves, the captain remains the captain. The answer is 1

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): People in the phone directory aren't unlisted by definition. Hence, none of the 100 people selected from the directory would have an unlisted number. None of provided answers reflect this fact. It would be 3 = None of above.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The size or jumping ability of the dog does not matter in this scenario. Neither the height of the house. A house cannot jump at all. Therefore the man's dog can technically jump higher than a house, making the correct choice 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): When you divide 100 by 10, you get 10. After that first division, you are no longer dividing 100. Thus, you can only divide 100 by 10 once. The answer is 1.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide sufficient information about the city's total population, how the police will identify the criminals, or how effective their search will be. Therefore, a specific number cannot be logically inferred. The answer is 3.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day always fall in the same year, regardless of the century or period. The answer is 1

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs, only hens do. So even if the farmer feeds his roosters every day, they will not produce eggs. The answer is 1

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fact that the playground was a football playground does not necessarily mean that only the football players can play there. Mark being a crazy fan of football does not necessarily mean that he would ignore players of other sports. Mark standing closest to football players would not necessarily make him ignore other players. Based on these pieces of information, none of the answer choices logically entail the reason Mark went directly to the footballer. The answer is 3.

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man being an athlete or fortunate enough to avoid all the rain does not mean he would stay completely dry. However, if he was in a coffin while the other men were at his funeral, he would not get wet despite the rain. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the woman became brave all of a sudden or tried to scare the bear, it still doesn't explain why she wasn't scared. The simplest explanation is that she was at a zoo where she knows she is safe from harm. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being a jumping athlete might not ensure he can jump from one house to another. If one house is much higher than another, it would not make the horizontal distance any shorter. If two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other, then it would be possible to jump the distance. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The accountant being his sister would resolve the issue. Despite the fact that the attorney claimed not to have a brother, the accountant, his sister, testified that the attorney was her brother. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The attorney is not angry and there is no information about their family problems. The accountant testified that the attorney is her brother but the attorney says he has no brother. The only possible way for both to be true is if the accountant were his sister. So the answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): One mother cannot give her $7 to her son as there's no son mentioned in the question. Two daughters sharing $7 would still not divide the total $21 equally among all participants. The only solution that allows for each to receive $7 is if the shopping is done by a grandmother, her daughter (who is also a mother), and her granddaughter (who is the daughter of the daughter). Thus, the answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all nine children are boys, then half of them would be boys (rounded down). Therefore, the statement becomes possible. The response is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first medicine right away, the second one half an hour later, and the third one after another half an hour. So you're occupied for one hour. The answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The bet was that the dog could jump higher than a house. A house cannot jump. Therefore the dog would always jump higher than a house. The answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the ground is not wet, then his feet would stay dry even without the boots. The answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs, so the rooster could not have laid an egg. The answer is 1.

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): James being at the zoo is the most logical answer. The bears would be unable to reach him due to the enclosures, even if they approached him. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill right away, the second half an hour later and the third half an hour after that. So, the pills last you one hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can only subtract 10 from 100 once. After the first time, you're subtracting from 90, not 100. The answer is 0

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the girls were not loved by their family or raised differently due to the lack of money, that wouldn't change the fact that they are twins. The only logical answer that could satisfy all the questions is that the girls were part of a set of triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The rumble of the train would not kill from fear or by crushing them with the shelf based on the information given. Romeo and Juliet are fish seems the most plausible answer. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The coach is the person who leads the team, especially if the vice coach is unable to attend a game. The answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The gender of the doctor and lawyer do not have an impact on who the shooter is. The dead man being a relative of the doctor and lawyer does not indicate that the mail man is the shooter. The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females. That means that the only person that could be John is the mail man. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): Old people do not necessarily consume more food than young people. Neither living longer nor having specific dietary requirements logically leads to consuming more food. However, older people might require increased nutrient intake, but that does not mean they eat more food than younger people. Therefore none of the answers are logically correct. The answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack were a human, someone might have been willing to help or he might have been scared but that would not necessarily cause his death. But if Jack is a fish, then being knocked out of the water would cause him to die. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fat dog is the thin dog's kid's parent but not the father, then the fat dog must be the mother. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male chickens and thus, cannot lay eggs. Therefore, the idea of the egg rolling on the roof is incorrect as the rooster cannot produce an egg. The answer is 2

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was an excellent football player that could avoid rain in high speed or lucky enough to avoid all the rain he would need to move and therefore would not have stayed completely dry. He was a photograph, the other people were there to honor a former player. This means he could not get wet because he wasn't physically there. The answer is 2.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The persons involved are one daughter, one mother, and one grandmother - three persons in total. The daughter is also the second mother's son, and the mother is also the second daughter's daughter. Each of them receives $7, totalling $21. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted phone numbers would not be in the phone directory so none of the people selected from the phone directory would have an unlisted phone number. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): Luck or high speed would not ensure someone stays dry in the rain. If he was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral, then he wouldn't be affected by the rain. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, then they could divide the $40 equally among themselves. The answer is 0.

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): Black sheep do need food, so they do eat. Black absorbing more heat from sunlight could mean they eat less to regulate their body temperature, but it does not necessarily mean they would eat less food than white sheep. The question does not specify any context about the sheep's location or weather. The fact that there are less black sheep in the world than white could mean that overall, white sheep consume more food than black sheep. The answer is 0.

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): If she tried to scare the bear or become brave in sudden, she would probably still be afraid. Being at the zoo would mean she's safe and not need to fear the bear. The answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): John does not have the ability to see into the future. Tom did not lose the wager by being kind. It is always 0-0 before any football game starts by default, so John would have won the bet by predicting that the score would be 0-0. The answer is 1

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If John possesses an extraordinary ability to see into the future or Tom gave his money to show his kindness, it does not explain how the bet played out. John saying the score would be 0-0 before any basketball game starts would make sense as the score is indeed always 0-0 before the game starts. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The captain would lead the team if the assistant captain were to resign. So, the answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): You can only subtract 10 from 100 once. After the first subtraction, you are no longer subtracting from 100, but from what remains after the initial subtraction (90, 80, 70, etc.). The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If half of the sheep are white, then all of them have to be white because half of 11 is not a whole number. The answer is 2

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The officer saying "I don't have a brother anymore" implies a gender-related situation rather than a familial or relational issue. It is possible if the officer was actually his sister. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If males make up half of the nine children, then the remaining children should also be males because half of 9 would always be rounded up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, all of the children are boys. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money or one of the boys was not loved by their family, they would still be twins if they were born on the same date and had the same parents. They could have another sibling making them triplets, not twins. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the third man was walking on his hands, his hands would be wet. However, if the ground is not wet or the third man is walking on stilts, his feet would be dry. Both answers 0 and 1 are plausible, but answer 1 is more fitting to the given scenario because it states that two men are wearing rubber boots, indicating the ground may be wet. So, the answer is 1.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. So John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. The answer is 0.

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): Whether or not a doctor or a lawyer can have the name John cannot be used as a reason to arrest. The dead man being a relative of both the doctor and lawyer is also not a reason to arrest someone. The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that "John" was the mail man. The answer is 0

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that the driver is told to make a stop every half an hour, for five times. However, it does not mention the duration of each stop. Without this information, it is impossible to calculate the total duration of the stops. Therefore, none of the provided answer choices can be logically entailed from the question details. The answer is 3.

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fish tank was like a ring, then the fishes can see each other every couple of few minutes even if they are swimming in the opposite directions. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of black sheep in the world being less than the number of white sheep would mean there are fewer black sheep to eat not that individual black sheep eat less than individual white sheep. Black sheep do need to eat. Black absorbing more heat from sunlight might affect the amount that black sheep eat, but it is not certain that it does. The answer is 2.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The girls cannot be identical twins, but they shared the same birthday, are related, and their parents look alike. The only logical explanation is they were triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the ground was not wet, then none of the men would have dry feet and the two other men would not need rubber boots. Hand walking would not ensure dry feet in a muddy meadow. The third man elevates his feet above the wet ground by walking on stilts. The answer is 1.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog being thin earlier or not being a responsible father does not explain the situation. The fat dog could be the mother and hence the parent of the thin dog without being its father. The answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): Although the guards were looking in opposite directions, they were not back to back. They were facing each other. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year. Christmas is on December 25 and New Year's Day is on January 1 of the following year. The answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): Yellowstone is a place, not a color that can be transferred to a shirt. Despite the name, Yellowstone cannot cause a white shirt to turn yellow. The answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lion being tied to a piece of metal does not imply that the other end is tied to anything else. Thus, the lion is able to reach the human that is 7m away because the other end is not tied to anything. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): The animals are all on the bed, not on the ground. Your own two legs are on the ground, as well as the four legs of the bed. So, the answer is Six. The bed's four legs, plus your two legs. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even a very strong woman would get hurt from falling 20 stories. The fireman being well exercised would not help him reach a woman 100 yards away in time to catch her if she falls 20 stories. She fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. The answer is 1.

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman does not typically have a beard. A superstar, regardless of how many times they shave will not maintain a beard. A barber could shave other people three times a day and still maintain their own beard. The answer is 1

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg hard or gently wouldn't prevent the egg from cracking without using some type of protection. The question refers to the egg cracking not the concrete floor. So, the answer is "No problem, because concrete floors are very hard to crack". The answer is 2.

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it was daytime, there would be no need to mention that all the lights were off because daylight would provide enough light to read. A smart man pretending to read a book doesn't necessarily mean he can actually read it. If the man was blind and reading braille, he wouldn't need lights. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air, and it was not built on the island, then the only explanation left involves the lake being frozen. So the answer is that the tractor was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The history teacher's friendship with a French person wouldn't necessarily mean they understand French. The English teacher using a translator requires her to have skills not mentioned in the question. The math teacher can understand the test as numbers are the same in French as they are in English. So, the answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was exhausted and lost his way home, he would not have returned 2 hours later. There is no correlation between a national holiday and him returning on Sunday. The simplest explanation is that the man's horse is named Sunday. The answer is 0.

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing the glass ball hard or gently would still likely result in it shattering against the brick wall. The question doesn't specify in which state the glass ball must remain after it has been thrown. The implication that the glass ball would not be shattered has intentionally been left out. None of these options provide a logical answer. The answer is 3.

Question 72: Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Emily was adopted or Emily and William share the same father but not mother, Lisa could still potentially be Emily's niece. If Lisa is Emily's daughter, then she could not be Emily's niece. The answer is 0.

Question 73: In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not state which room the police would extinguish the fire in first. It is the firefighters that extinguish fires, not the police. The answer is 3

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?
Model Answer (Wrong): The history teacher knowing someone from France or the English teacher having experience with a translator does not necessarily mean they can understand French. The most logical choice is the math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even with medical attention, a man would get hurt jumping off a 50-story building. The height of the building is relative to the man, so it's not a factor. If he jumped off the ground floor, he wouldn't get hurt. The answer is 1.

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Regardless of how tall the ladder is, a fall can result in an injury. The provision of medical attention does not prevent injury but treats it. If he was only on the first step, he wouldn't have far to fall and thus wouldn't get hurt. The answer is 2.

Question 77: You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tide would make the boats float again. Village people using the boat to store water or fruits would not explain why you see no water around them. The answer is 0.

Question 78: He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A writer would have written a word. A businessman doesn't have to write words or author books. A publisher publishes and sometimes authors books but doesn't necessarily write the words. The answer is 1.

Question 79: In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the house had no lights at all and there was no candle, lamp, or other light source, then it would be impossible for a man to read a book, unless the man is blind and is reading braille. The answer is 1

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): The likelihood of dolphins untying the knots is low, and powerful waves would not push the boat and the marina together. The answer lies in the fact that the station to which the boat was attached was not fixed. Thus, the boat and the station could have been carried away by the water currents or tide. The answer is 0.

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg gently or hard against a hard rock wall would break it. The phrase "concrete floors are very hard to crack" does not make sense in this context, as we are talking about throwing an egg against a wall. The question doesn't specify that you have to throw the egg hard. Therefore, none of the given choices provide a valid solution to the question. The answer is 3

Question 82: You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the people on the boat jumped into the sea in a moment, you would still potentially see them in the water. The boat being big does not necessarily mean that people would hide themselves in a moment. The fact that all people on the boat are in relationships would not impact their visibility. The phrase "you don't see a single person on the boat" could refer to the relationship status of the individuals, indicating that all are in relationships and thus, are not single. So, the answer is 2.

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): Regardless of whether it is the Red Sea or a red body of water, the shirt does not absorb the color of the water. The shirt would potentially get wet in the Red Sea, but it would not turn red. Hence, none of the options are correct. The answer is 3.

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the first coffee shop is too far away, he would not stop there in the morning. If the second coffee shop is too far away, he would not stop there in the evening. Walking downhill both to work and back home does not explain why he visits different coffee shops at different times of the day. None of the choices logically answer the question. The answer is 3.

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?
Model Answer (Wrong): All these options are irrelevant to the scenario or don't explain the situation logically. The restaurant could have reservations for later, been closed for a private event or some other reason, but none of these possibilities are addressed in the options. Thus, the answer is 3.

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Getting medical attention would not guarantee that he was unharmed. If he fell from a 100-foot ladder, then the ladder is tall for everyone, not just boys. If he was only on the first step when he fell, then he would not be harmed. The answer is 1.

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The first line of the question states "Mary's father has five children", so it's apparent that Mary is one of the five children. The other four have been named as Nana, None, Nine, and Non. So, the fifth child's name is Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): Policemen do not put out fires. Firefighters do. The answer is 3.

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the runner ran 70 kilometers in 5 days and ran 2 kilometers more each day than the previous day, the runner ran on the first day 12 kilometers. So, the answer is 3 "none of the above".

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of the tractor falling within hail to the island or floating over the lake are not probable scenarios. It makes most sense that it was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen, providing a solid surface upon which vehicles can be driven. The answer is 2

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): If a professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day competition, and he caught three more fish each day than the day before, then he caught one fish on the first day to make this arithmetic progression possible. The answer is 1.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack is adopted, Tony's nephew could still be Jack's nephew. If Jack and Tony share the same father but not the same mother, Tony's nephew could still be Jack's nephew. Tony's nephew could be Jack's son. The answer is 0.

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you shoot one bird, the noise would scare off the remaining birds from the fence. Therefore, there would be zero birds left sitting on the fence. The answer is 3.

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being a superstar or finishing a dish without waste does not exempt a person from paying for their meal at a restaurant. If the man works at the restaurant, it's possible that he gets his meals for free as an employee benefit. The answer is 0.

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Each daughter sharing the same brother is the most logical choice. So, Mrs. Jones has four daughters and one son. The answer is 2.

Question 96: You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?
Model Answer (Wrong): In the context given, each head of the organization represents one person. So if you have entered the room as well, that means there are a total of six heads - five heads of the organization and your's. However, this choice isn't given. Therefore, taking into account all the given choices, none of them are correct. The answer is 3.

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If next week is a national holiday, it would not make Sunday occur on two consecutive days. If the hotel room was too expensive, the man would not have been able to stay overnight and return the next day on Sunday. If his horse was called Sunday, then the man would have been able to leave and return on Sunday. The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the first train station was too far away then the student would not be able to ride to it on his scooter. If the second train station was too far away then the student would not be able to ride home from it on his scooter. The stations and his home being on a hill would allow the student to easily ride down on his scooter. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If there are five players and only six participants in total, this means that each player shares the same coach. The answer is 0.

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Emily is adopted or Emily and William share the same father but not the mother, Lisa would still be Emily's niece if she is William's niece. If Lisa is Emily's daughter, then she would be William's niece and also Emily's daughter. The answer is 2.

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The stations and his home being on a hill would allow him to ride down easily on his scooter. The first train station being too far away and the second train station being too far away contradict the premise of the question. The Answer is 1.

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not give the firemen enough knowledge to identify the burglars. It is not clear if the two people covering their face were doing so because of the smoke or if they were the burglars. The two with no masks could be the burglars as well. Therefore, the firemen could not arrest anyone based on the information given. The answer is 3.

Question 103: If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The simplest explanation is that the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, allowing the dog to reach the bone. The rope stretching or the dog digging a tunnel introduces unnecessary complexity. The answer is 0.

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if Jessica is smart and pretending to read the book, it would not make sense for her to always read in complete darkness. Even if it is daytime, you could not read in complete darkness. If Jessica is blind and she can braille, then she could read in the dark. The answer is 2.

Question 105: A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The national holiday or hotel room expense do not necessarily affect the day he can ride back. The man could have ridden back to town on Sunday if his horse was named Sunday. The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Amy would not be able to reach the base in a second to catch the pet. The pet falling from the 17th floor would be fatal regardless of the pet's strength. The pet dog fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. The answer is 2.

Question 107: Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You shoot one. How many are there left?
Model Answer (Wrong): The noise of the shot would likely scare all the birds away, leaving none behind. So, the answer is 3.

Question 108: He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A teacher or lawyer doesn't conduct weddings. A preacher, however, does. They can marry many women (as in administering the wedding ceremony), but that doesn't mean they themselves have been married. The answer is 1.

Question 109: Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names. What is the name of the fifth child?
Model Answer (Wrong): Mary is the name of the fifth child. Since the sentence begins with "Mary's father is the father of five children," this means that Mary is one of his five children. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 110: Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that Ana's school has four students in Alaska: Maria, James, and Jonghyun. The other student is Ana. The answer is 1.

Question 111: A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a bruise. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the woman is strong enough or the fireman is well exercised, a fall from a 20-story building would cause more than just a bruise. If she fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside, she wouldn't get more than a bruise. The answer is 1

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman does not typically grow a beard. A superstar has no relevance to the scenario. A barber can shave three times a day (or more) because he's shaving other people, not himself, and still grow a beard. The answer is 1.

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the students have not learned English yet, then they would not have been able to use translation tools or guess the homework answers based on prior knowledge. Mathematics is a universal language. If Tom is a Math teacher, then the numbers would be the same in English as they are in Chinese. The answer is 1.

Question 114: If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?
Model Answer (Wrong): The Red Sea is a body of water and it will not change the color of the shirt. However, the shirt may become wet. Since none of the options indicate that the shirt will become wet, the answer is 3, None of above.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The number of people on the boat does not change whether the people on the boat are in relationships. When it is said there is not a single person on the boat, it means there are no unmarried people on the boat. The answer is 2.

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fisherman caught 30 fish, increasing his catch by 3 each day, it can be calculated that he caught one fish on the first day. The sequence would be Day 1: 1 fish, Day 2: 4 fish, Day 3: 7 fish, Day 4: 10 fish, Day 5: 13 fish. This gives a total of 35 fish.  The answer is 1.

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Searching on google requires an internet connection. If the internet was disconnected, he could not search on google. The answer is 2.

Question 118: He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?
Model Answer (Wrong): A preacher often conducts wedding ceremonies, meaning he marries others, but not himself. The answer is 1.

Question 119: You walk into a room and see a bed and lie on it. On the bed, there are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose. There are also three doves flying above the bed. How many legs are on the floor?
Model Answer (Wrong): The bed's four legs are on the floor. Your two legs are also on the floor when you lie down. The animals are all on the bed, so their legs are not on the floor. Hence, the total number of legs on the floor is six. The answer is 1.

Question 120: Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some brothers were not loved by family and moved away, then Mrs. Jones would have more than five kids. If some daughters get married and have their own family, this also doesn't reduce the number of Mrs. Jones' children. The only way for Mrs. Jones to have five kids, with four daughters each having a brother and only one brother overall, is that each daughter shares the same brother. The answer is 2.
