System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: That the rope is not tied to anything else is the simplest choice. The horse can reach the hay whenever he chooses. The answer is 1
                Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?
                Choices: 0 = Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.; 1 = The ground outside the building is wet.; 2 = Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: A person cannot jump out of a 22 story building without injury. Brad must have jumped into the building. The answer is 0
                Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend?
                Choices: 0 = He told Danny to left the bridge.; 1 = He told Danny to overturn the track.; 2 = He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Danny has to reduce the height of his truck to pass the bridge. Letting the air out of his tires reduces the truck's height. The answer is 2
                Question: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why?
                Choices: 0 = I am a dentist.; 1 = I am a thief.; 2 = I am a miner.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Thieves and miners do not create gold crowns or bridges. Tiny crowns and bridges are dental work. People don't like going to the dentist. The answer is 0
                Question: Each of the 30 participants in the masquerade had to wear a unique hat to distinguish themselves from one another. The host, however, only tallied 29 when he counted the number of hats to determine attendance. All 30 persons had signed their names on the spreadsheet, which confused him. He repeated the count. There are still 29. How is that even doable?
                Choices: 0 = One person had a pretty beautiful hat.; 1 = The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it.; 2 = One person had moved away from the group when the host was counting.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If one person had a pretty beautiful hat, then the host would still count 30 hats. If one person had moved away from the group when the host was counting, then the host would still count 30 hats. The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it. The answer is 1
                Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.; 1 = The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.; 2 = The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Dinosaurs are no longer alive, so they cannot live happily. Butterflies can give birth to offspring, so they are not the answer. Mules are born sterile, so they cannot give birth to offspring. The answer is 2
                Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The 6th woman beated them at the end.; 1 = The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.; 2 = The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If the sixth woman beat them or walked slowly to dodge the snow she would not have reached the cabin at the same time. If the sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying, then she would not be cold and would not have to hurry. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The riddle does not suggest that the diligent farmer has forgotten his father or that the lazy farmer is irresponsible, rather, it is inferring a gender role. The lazy farmer is the mother of the diligent farmer. The answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were sleeping and scared by the sound of track, then there will be no shards of glass and water on the floor. If the shelf crushed them, there still wouldn't be water and glass shards on the floor. Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): Every year, the day before your birthday, you are technically one year younger than you will be tomorrow, which is your birthday. The answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sporting organization, if the assistant captain departs, the captain would continue to serve as the team's captain. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted numbers are not included in the phone directory. So if you're picking names from the directory, none of them will have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): Two guards cannot see each other's faces if they are looking in opposite directions, unless they are facing each other. An unusual vision or big action does not allow a guard to see behind him. The answer is 0

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): A house cannot jump, so technically, the dog can jump higher than the house. Therefore, it is possible. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dividing 100 by 10 would result in 10. Thereafter, dividing by 10 again would not yield 10. Thus, the correct answer is 1.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The text does not provide information on how many criminals the police can find, so none of the choices logically follows from the information given. The answer is 3.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day always fall in the same year. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male and cannot lay eggs. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not specify that Mark knew who the person was that people got excited for in the first place. It is not specified that the playground is a football playground and other players could not be playing at the time of the announcement. Mark being a crazy fan of football does not mean he would not recognize great players in other sports. Mark standing closest to the football players does not mean he only focused on football players and did not notice others. The question does not provide enough information for any of the choices to be correct. The answer is 3.

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man is high-speed or lucky, he would still get wet in the rain. The man did not get wet because he was in a coffin at a funeral. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): Rushing towards a bear in the wild on a sudden burst of courage or to scare it can be dangerous behavior. The bear the woman saw could have been in a zoo, meaning it was safe to approach. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): A man cannot fly using athleticism. A house that is much higher than another one does not necessarily mean he can fly in the air. If two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other, it would be possible to jump from one to the other. The answer is 1

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the attorney had moved away when he was young, or cut ties with his sibling, it would not change the fact that he had a brother. For the attorney to truthfully testify that he did not have a brother, the accountant must not be his brother. However, the accountant could be his sister. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The attorney would still have a brother whether he was angry about his sibling's profession, he moved away when he was young, or for any other reasons. Considering the attorney does not deny having a sister, it is possible that the accountant is his sister. The answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one mother gave her $7 to her son, there would be three people involved, not four. Two daughters sharing the $7 would mean each gets $3.50, not $7. If they are one daughter, one mother, and one grandmother, then there would be three people, each of whom is also a mother and a daughter, meaning there are two mothers and two daughters. This would allow $21 to be divided evenly into $7 each. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all of the children are boys, then it is true that half of them are boys. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): You start with the first medicine. You take the second medicine after half an hour, and the third medicine after another half hour. That's one hour in total. The answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement "a dog can jump higher than a house" is true not because of the dog's jumping ability, but because houses can't jump at all. So the answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the ground was not wet, even without rubber boots, his feet would be dry. Thus, the answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs. Only hens lay eggs. The answer is 1

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If James was at the zoo, then he would be separated from the bears by a barrier. Bears cannot judge if a person is unhealthy from just a look. Temperature does not affect a bear's behavior towards humans in such a manner. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You would take the first pill immediately, the second after 30 minutes, and the third after another 30 minutes. Therefore, the pills would last you an hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): When you take 10 from 100, it becomes 90. Therefore, you can only subtract 10 from 100 once. After the first time, you would be subtracting from 90, not 100. The answer is 0

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were triplets, they could truthfully answer yes to all the questions and still not be twins. The socio-economic status of the family and the fact that one girl might not be loved by her family would not change the fact that they are twins. The answer is 0.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Romeo and Juliet were scared by the sound of the track, they would not necessarily die from it. If the shelf crushed them, there would likely be more evidence of damage in the room. The scenario that fits best with the clues provided is that Romeo and Juliet were fish and the rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, causing it to break and leaving them unable to survive out of water. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The coach is generally in charge of a sports team. If the vice coach is unable to attend a game, the coach would naturally take the lead. The answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question isn't about the relationship between the dead man and the others, nor does it imply that a doctor or a lawyer can't be named John. The only logical explanation is that the mailman was the only male and should therefore be named John. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): The claim that old people consume more food than young people is not necessarily true. Therefore, none of the given choices accurately answer the question. The answer is 3

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being knocked out by a wave would not kill Jack unless he drowned, but if Jack is a fish, being out of the water would mean he could not breathe. Hence, he would die. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fat dog is not the thin dog's father but is the parent of the thin dog, then the fat dog must be the mother. The answer is 2

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs, so it didn't roll anywhere. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was a football player or was lucky enough to avoid all the rain, he would still get wet because of the shower. However, if he was a photograph, he wouldn't physically get wet. The answer is 2.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If there are one daughter, one mother, and one grandmother, there are two daughters and two mothers, and the money can be divided by three. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted phone numbers are not included in the phone directory, so none of the people selected from the phone directory would have unlisted numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man is lucky or an athlete, he cannot avoid all the rain if he remains outside. If he was in a coffin, he would be inside and thus not wet. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If each kid's parents pooled $10 for division, that would result in $20, which is not equal to the $40 they have. If Jack and Tom are brothers who share the same parents, then they would not divide $40 equally amongst themselves. If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves then they can divide $40 equally amongst themselves. The answer is 0

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The quantity of food consumed by a sheep does not depend on the color of its wool. Also, it's incorrect to say black sheep do not need food. The difference in food consumption is due to the number of white sheep being more than the black sheep. The answer is 0

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): Running towards a bear in the wild would be dangerous. If she was at the zoo, she would be safe while observing the bear. So, the answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): Having the ability to predict the future does not guarantee being correct, and giving money away isn't the same as a bet. The most logical explanation would be that John predicted that the score before the start of any football game is always 0-0. As a result, Tom has lost the bet because technically, John is correct. Hence, the answer is 1.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John predicting the score before the game would not necessarily make Tom lose the bet. John seeing into the future is unlikely and not based in reality. Tom intentionally giving away his money is also unlikely. The most reasonable choice is that John predicted the score would be 0-0 before the game started, and he was right. This is always guaranteed before any game starts. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The captain of a sports team would lead the team if an assistant captain were to resign. The answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Once you subtract 10 from 100, you have 90 left. You can't subtract 10 from 100 again because it's now 90. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Half of 11 sheep is 5.5, which is an impossible count for physical sheep. However, it can be possible if all 11 sheep are white. In other words, one half of 11 sheep are white and the other half are also white. The answer is 2.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the officer was a sister, she could not have a brother and the same could go for James, making the story logical. Hence, the answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all of the children are boys, then males would make up all of them, not just half. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the boys live in the same house, have the same parents, were born on the same date, and are not twins, that means there must be at least one other sibling who shares their birthday. The only answer that fits these conditions is that they are triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the third man was walking on his hands, his feet may remain dry but his hands would get wet. If he is walking on stilts, he might keep his feet dry, but the question does not provide this information. The most direct answer according to logic here is that there's no wetness on the ground, so even without boots, the man's feet remain dry. The answer is 0

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John can't predict the future and Tom wouldn't lose the bet just by being kind. Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0, which is what John said. The answer is 0.

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the dead man was a relative of both the doctor and the lawyer, that would not help the cop determine who "John" is. Thinking a doctor or a lawyer won't have the name John is a stereotype and not a factual statement. The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females, so the cop knew that "John" was the mail man. The answer is 0.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The driver would not need to stop at the beginning of the journey, so the stops would happen at the end of each half-hour interval. For five stops, this would be after 2 and a half hours. The answer is 1.

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fishes can't see each other every couple of minutes if they swim in opposite directions unless the fish tank is like a ring that allows them to swim continuously and encounter each other. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of a sheep's wool does not affect its appetite. The number of sheep does affect how much they eat in total. There are fewer black sheep, so they eat less in total. The answer is 2

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The girls could only be referring to other siblings if they were not identical twins. They could be triplets, or quadruplets, but they couldn't be the only two children. The answer is 0

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the ground was not wet, no one would need boots or stilts. If the third man is walking on his hands, his hands would be wet. By walking on stilts, the third man can keep his feet dry. The answer is 1

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog could be the mother of the thin dog, as the question specifies the fat dog is not the father. The other choices do not logically follow from the given information. The answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the smiling guard's action was so big that even the guard behind him can see it, then the guard would not have to ask why he was smiling. A guard cannot see what is happening behind him from the front, so it is impossible for the one guard to use unusual vision to see the other. The two guards were facing each other, although they were looking in opposite directions. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day occur in every year. The answer is 1

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): Yellowstone is a location, not a color or material, so it can't transfer color to a shirt. Therefore, none of the choices are logically entailed by the question. The answer is 3.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): The simplest option is that the rope is not tied to anything at the other end. This gives the Lion the freedom to reach the human that is 7m away. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): Beds usually stand on four legs. Humans usually stand and walk on two legs. None of the animals the person would see are said to be on the ground. The answer is 1.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): No one can survive a fall from a 20-story building without injury. The fireman cannot reach the woman in a second from 100 yards away. If the woman jumped back into her apartment, she would not be seriously injured. The answer is 1

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman typically does not need to shave, and a superstar will not keep a beard if he shaves three times a day. A barber, on the other hand, shaves other people's faces multiple times a day while maintaining his own beard. The answer is 1.

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Whether you drop the egg gently or hard, a raw egg will crack when it hits a concrete floor. Concrete floors are very hard and do not crack easily. The egg does not crack the concrete. The answer is 2.

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it was daytime, then there would be light naturally. A blind man may be reading braille even when there's no light source. A man pretending to read doesn't necessarily mean he's really reading. The answer is 2.

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tractor cannot float or fall within hail to the island. However, when lakes freeze in the winter, they can be crossed. The tractor must have been driven over on the ice. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tests were done in French, and none of the teachers spoke French, so her history and English teachers would not be able to understand the French language. Math, on the other hand, is a universal language. Numbers and equations would likely look the same regardless of the language used. As a result, her math teacher would have been able to understand the material. The answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man's ride time doesn't affect what day it is. A national holiday next week doesn't make a Friday into a Sunday. If his horse was called Sunday, he could ride out on Friday night and ride back on Sunday. The answer is 0.

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of these options would prevent a fragile glass ball from shattering upon hitting a sturdy brick wall. Hard or gentle, the glass ball would still break. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 72: Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Lisa is Emily's daughter, then she would not be Emily's niece. Adoption or having different mothers does not change the fact that Lisa should still be Emily's niece if she is William's niece. Hence, Lisa must be Emily's daughter. The answer is 0.

Question 73: In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?
Model Answer (Wrong): This question cannot be answered with the given choices, because it doesn't specify which room the police would extinguish first. Therefore, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?
Model Answer (Wrong): The answer is the math teacher, because numbers are the same in French as they are in English. The language of mathematics is universally understood, regardless if the exam was taken in French. The answer is 2.

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jumping off of a tall building, such as a 50-story one, would lead to significant injury or death. Immediate medical attention is unlikely to prevent harm. If the building is not so tall for the man, that doesn't change the height of the building. If he jumped off the ground floor, then he would not be harmed because the jump would not be from a significant height. The answer is 1.

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the boy was only on the first step, he wouldn't fall a significant distance and therefore wouldn't get hurt. The answer is 2.

Question 77: You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The tide is a possibility in coastal areas or seasides. When the tide rises, it could make the boats float again. This happens in many costal villages. The answer is 0.

Question 78: He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A businessman or writer who does not write would not be credited with authoring books. A publisher may be involved with many books, but would not be the author. The question implies that the person has many books credited to them but does not write themselves. In a riddle context, none of the given options logically entails the implied answer that the person is a typewriter or a computer or in modern days, a speech recognition software. Hence, the answer is 3

Question 79: In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man is smart and pretending to read the book, it does not explain how he is able to read it. If it is daytime, it would contradict with the statement that it was night in the story. The only logical explanation left is that the man is blind and is reading braille. The answer is 1.

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the boat was properly tied to a station, it would have remained in the marina, and powerfully waves would unlikely send it to the middle of the ocean. Dolphins untie knots is implausible. If the station wasn't fixed in the marina, it could have allowed the boat to drift away. The answer is 0

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg gently or hard against a hard rock wall would break it. Concrete floors are not related to throwing an egg against a wall. None of the given choices logically entail the answer. The answer is 3

Question 82: You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question asked why you don't see a single person, not why you don't see any people. If everyone on the boat is in a relationship, then there are no single people. The answer is 2

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea does not change its color, so it remains white. The answer is 1.

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home. The answer is 0

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the given choices provide a reasonable explanation for the restaurant being empty despite being fully booked. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the young man was on the first step of the ladder when he fell, he would not be seriously injured. Height is a major factor in the severity of a fall. The greater the height, the more severe the fall. If the ladder is not so tall for the boys, it still implies a considerable height. Receiving medical attention does not prevent injury; it treats injury. The answer is 1

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The names of the four children are given as Nana, None, Nine, and Non. The name of the fifth child is mentioned in the question itself - Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): Policemen do not put out fires, that's the work of firefighters. So none of the rooms were put out by policemen. The answer is 3.

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the runner ran 70 kilometers in five days, and each day he ran two kilometers more than the previous day, you can work backward from the total. Subtracting 2 kilometers for each day prior to the last gives you:
- Day 5: 18km, Day 4:16km, Day 3:14km, Day 2:12km, Day 1:10km. Therefore, the runner ran 10 kilometers on the first day. However, this choice isn't given in the provided options. So, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of the tractor falling within hail to the island or floating over the lake do not provide a feasible explanation. The most logical explanation is that the tractor was driven over in winter when the lake was frozen. The answer is 2

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): Given the daily increment and the total number of fish, the fisherman must have started with a smaller number on the first day. This can be solved through arithmetic calculations. The answer is 0. The fisherman caught two fish on the first day.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Tony's nephew is Jack's son, that means Jack is the father of the nephew and not his uncle, thus making the statement true. The answer is 0.

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you shoot one bird, the sound of the gunshot would likely scare the rest away. Therefore, none would be left on the fence. The answer is 3

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If a man goes to a restaurant everyday without paying, it is likely because he works there in the restaurant. Despite being a superstar or always finishing his dish without any waste, he should still pay for his meals. The answer is 0.

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): All the daughters of Mrs. Jones share the same brother. Hence, altogether, Mrs. Jones has five children. This includes one son and four daughters. The answer is 2

Question 96: You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states there are five heads from the organization and you also have a head. That makes six heads total in the room. None of the provided answer choices correctly fulfill this, so the answer has to be 3.

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man's horse being called Sunday is the only choice that would allow him to leave and return on "Sunday". The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the first or second train station are too far away, he wouldn't be able to reach them with his scooter. If the stations and his home are on a hill, this would allow him to easily ride down on his scooter both when going to the first station in the morning and returning from the second in the afternoon. The answer is 2

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If each player shares the same coach, there would be six people in the team. The number of players allowed to play, or a coach's salary, does not affect the total number of participants. The answer is 0.

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Lisa being Emily's daughter would make her Emily's niece. Emily and William sharing the same father but not mother doesn't negate the possibility of Lisa being Emily's niece. If Emily was adopted, Lisa could still be Emily's niece by marriage or blood relation. None of the options accurately answer the question. The answer is 3.

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the first train station is too far away or the second train station is too far away, it would not fit the given scenario. The student is leaning forward on his scooter to reduce air resistance and maintain his speed, implying that the stations and his home are on a hill. This allows him to board at the first stop and exit at the second stop. The answer is 1.

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?
Model Answer (Wrong): Firemen are not law enforcement officers, and therefore do not have the authority to arrest individuals. The answer is 3

Question 103: If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, the dog can reach the bone. The simplest answer is often the correct one. The answer is 0.

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jessica cannot read a traditional book in complete darkness, whether it's day or night does not matter in absolute darkness. If she was pretending to read the book, there would be no reason for her parents to reward her "hard work." If Jessica is blind and she reads braille, she doesn't need light to read. The answer is 2

Question 105: A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The horse's name has to be Sunday for this to be possible. It does not depend on if there is a national holiday or whether the hotel room was expensive. The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): The dog wouldn't remain unharmed if it fell from the 17th floor, regardless of how strong it is or how quickly Amy can reach the base. However, if the dog fell back into the apartment from the balcony, it would remain unharmed. The answer is 2.

Question 107: Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You shoot one. How many are there left?
Model Answer (Wrong): The noise from the shot presumably scared all the birds away, so there are no birds left on the fence. The answer is 3.

Question 108: He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A lawyer does not typically conduct marriage ceremonies, and a teacher has no official role in a marriage ceremony. A preacher, on the other hand, often conducts or officiates marriage ceremonies, thereby 'marrying' others without being married himself. The answer is 1.

Question 109: Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names. What is the name of the fifth child?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question already tells us that Mary's father is the father of five children so it's logical to infer that Mary is one of those five children. The answer is 2.

Question 110: Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?
Model Answer (Wrong): Since Ana's school is the one being discussed, it's implied that Ana is also a student there. So, the other student is Ana. The answer is 1.

Question 111: A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a bruise. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): A human cannot survive a 20-story fall without much more than a bruise. The woman must have fallen into the inside of her apartment, not from the balcony. The answer is 1.

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman cannot grow a beard, so she is not the answer. A superstar does not necessarily shave three times a day and still grow a beard, so he is not the answer. A barber can shave other people's beards three times a day and still grow his own beard. The answer is 1.

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the students have not learned English yet, they cannot use translation tools or rely on their prior knowledge to guess the homework answers. Therefore, the homework must have been in a subject that is the same in English and Chinese. Numbers are the same in Chinese as they are in English. The answer is 1.

Question 114: If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not specify that the shirt will change color when thrown into the Red Sea. It will get wet. None of the provided choices are correct. The answer is 3.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the people jumped into the sea or hid themselves in a moment, they wouldn't still be on the boat. The phrase "not a single person" can refer to the relationship status of the people. Therefore, saying there is "not a single person", it implies that all the people on the boat are in relationships. The answer is 2.

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): According to an arithmetic progression, if each day he caught three more fish than the day before, starting from the first day to the fifth day, he would have caught 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14 fish respectively, which sums up to 30 fish. Therefore, the fisherman caught one fish on the first day. The answer is 1.

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Without an internet connection, Bob would be unable to use Google to conduct a search. As a result, the answer is 2.

Question 120: Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some brothers were not loved by the family and moved away or if some daughters got married and moved away, Mrs. Jones would still have more than five children. If each daughter shares the same brother, then Mrs. Jones would only have five children. The answer is 2.
