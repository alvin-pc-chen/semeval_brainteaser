Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): From the information given, we know that the runner runs 70 kilometers in total over 5 days. Let's assume that on the first day, the runner ran x kilometers. On the second day, the runner ran x + 2 kilometers. On the third day, the runner ran x + 4 kilometers. On the fourth day, the runner ran x + 6 kilometers. On the fifth day, the runner ran x + 8 kilometers.

So, the total distance can be represented as:
x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 70

Simplifying the equation, we get:
5x + 20 = 70

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
5x = 50

Dividing both sides by 5:
x = 10

Therefore, the runner ran 10 kilometers on the first day. The answer is 10.
