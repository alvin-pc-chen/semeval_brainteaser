System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: A couple is having a disagreement over the man's error. The man kept apologizing and pleading with the woman to allow him to see her directly. The woman was still upset. Thus, she wouldn't agree. The couple, though, was positioned on the same mat. How is that even doable?
                Choices: 0 = The mat was folded in multiple times and end up with a special shape.; 1 = The woman kept turning her back to the man.; 2 = The couple was standing on two sides of the girl's apartment door, which had a rug under it.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The couple are standing on the same mat but cannot see each other, which suggests that there is a barrier between them. Regardless of how the mat was folded, it would not prevent the couple from seeing each other. Even if the woman turned her back to the man he would still see her. Therefore, the couple was standing on two sides of a door, which had a rug under it. The answer is 2
                Question: Eight people were sitting under a large tree. Suddenly, a gust of wind blows, yet none of them got hit by any falling leaves. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = It was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves.; 1 = People were camping under the tree.; 2 = The wind blows heavily.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If the people were camping under the tree, they would still be hit by the falling leaves. The wind blowing heavily would cause the leaves to fall. If it was winter and the tree doesn't have any leaves, then the people would not be hit by any falling leaves. The answer is 0
                Question: The ship was in the central Pacific Ocean. The ship suddenly began to sink without being crushed. However, each team was still preoccupied with its own tasks, so none was threatening. Why?
                Choices: 0 = An underwater earthquake caused a rapid drop in the water level and resulted in the loss of buoyancy for the ship.; 1 = It was a Submarine.; 2 = There are too many fish around the ship.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: An earthquake would cause people to feel threatened, and fish around the ship would not matter. If the ship were a submarine, it would be designed to sink. The answer is 1
                Question: Two mothers and two daughters were asking for new state IDs, but the agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out. Why?
                Choices: 0 = They are one daughters, one mother and one grandmother.; 1 = Two girls filled the from together.; 2 = One mother is too old to apply for new IDs.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The agent only gave out three forms and instructed them on how to fill them out, which suggests that there are only three people. If they are one daughter, one mother, and one grandmother, then there would be three people. The answer is 0
                Question: Every night, a man would sleep with a light on, as bright as the sun, dazzling the neighbors. But why did his neighbors never complain?
                Choices: 0 = All his neighbors are blind.; 1 = The man would wake up early.; 2 = He lived in a light house.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If all his neighbors are blind, they would not be dazzled by the light. If the man lived in a light house then the light would be expected. The answer is 2 
                Question: Each of the 30 participants in the masquerade had to wear a unique hat to distinguish themselves from one another. The host, however, only tallied 29 when he counted the number of hats to determine attendance. All 30 persons had signed their names on the spreadsheet, which confused him. He repeated the count. There are still 29. How is that even doable?
                Choices: 0 = One person had a pretty beautiful hat.; 1 = The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it.; 2 = One person had moved away from the group when the host was counting.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If one person had a pretty beautiful hat, then the host would still count 30 hats. If one person had moved away from the group when the host was counting, then the host would still count 30 hats. The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it. The answer is 1
                Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.; 1 = The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.; 2 = The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Dinosaurs are no longer alive, so they cannot live happily. Butterflies can give birth to offspring, so they are not the answer. Mules are born sterile, so they cannot give birth to offspring. The answer is 2
                Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The 6th woman beated them at the end.; 1 = The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.; 2 = The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If the sixth woman beat them or walked slowly to dodge the snow she would not have reached the cabin at the same time. If the sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying, then she would not be cold and would not have to hurry. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even though the lazy farmer is the parent of the diligent farmer, there is no information indicating that the lazy farmer is not responsible or that the diligent farmer forgot his father. The lazy farmer may be his mother though, this would fit the situation given "the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer". The answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were sleeping and got scared by the sound of the track, they would not be dead. The rumble of the train moving the shelf would not necessarily crush them. However, if Romeo and Juliet are fish, and the rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive. This would leave them dead and also provide an explanation for the glass shards and water on the floor. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): This phrase is a bit of a trick question. As long as you haven't had your birthday this year yet, "before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow" applies because today you are still one year younger than you will be after your birthday. So it happens every year. The answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In most sporting organizations, if the assistant captain (or vice captain) leaves, the captain of the team would continue to serve in a leadership capacity. The first officer and second officer are not commonly used ranks in sports teams. Thus, the answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you pick 100 names at random from the city's phone directory, those names will have listed phone numbers, because if a number is unlisted it will not be in the directory. Therefore, none of these 100 people would have an unlisted number. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the guards were back to back, they would not be able to see each other's expressions. If one guard could see what was happening behind him or if the smiling was noticeable enough for the other guard to see it, it is not very plausible. If the guards were facing each other while looking in opposite directions, they would be able to see each other's expressions. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the height of the tiny house was lower than the dog, the neighbor would have won the bet. The breed of dog is not relevant to the house's ability to jump. As a house can not jump, any height of a jump from the dog would be higher. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dividing 100 by 10 gives the result of 10. If you try to divide 100 by 10 again, you would not get a proper decimal number. Therefore, it's possible to divide 100 by 10 once. The answer is 1.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide enough information about the total population of the city nor the specific efforts taken by the police to apprehend the criminals to offer an accurate estimation of how many additional criminals they could potentially find. The answer is 3, None of above.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day always fall in the same year, regardless of the era or century. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs, only hens do. The answer is 1

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not specify that the playground was a football playground. It also does not specify that Mark was a crazy fan of football or that he stood closest to the football players. However, if Mark directly went to a footballer and took a photo with him, he must have known that this was the person that people got excited for. The only option that makes sense is that the playground was a football playground and the other players could've not been playing in the playground at the time of the announcement. The answer is 0.

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was an athlete or lucky, he would not avoid getting wet. However, if he was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral, this would explain why he remained dry. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): Running towards a bear would not necessarily make one brave or scare the bear away. However, if she was at a zoo, she would know that she is safe due to the protective barriers between her and the bear. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man is a jumping athlete, it would be implausible for him to jump from one house to another unless they are extremely close. The notion of the houses being at different heights causing him to "fly" through the air doesn't seem logical. It is more likely and doable that the two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the accountant was his sister, she could correctly say that the attorney is her brother. This explains why the attorney can say he doesn't have a brother - because he has a sister. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the attorney is angry about his brother or was not loved by his family, it would not change the fact that the accountant is his sibling. Thus, if both are telling the truth, the possible explanation is that the accountant is a sister to the attorney. The answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one mother gave her $7 to her son, the son is not supposed to be part of the equation. Also, if two daughters shared the $7, there would still need to be extra money for the two remaining individuals. However, if there is one daughter, one mother, and one grandmother, they could be count as two mothers and two daughters while being only three individuals. They can each have $7 of the total $21. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all of the man's children are boys, then it is true that half of them are boys. The answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you take the first medicine right away and then take the other two every half hour, it will take you an hour in total to take all the medicine. The answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Regardless of the species of the dog or the size of the house, the man would generally never be able to get a dog to jump higher than a house. But the trick here is in the semantics of the bet. By stating the dog can jump "higher than a house", it inherently implies the house has the ability to jump, which in reality, a house cannot. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the student was walking on their hands, their hands would be wet instead of their feet. Walking on stilts would keep their feet dry, but the prompt doesn't mention stilts. If the ground is not wet, then their feet will remain dry no matter what. Therefore, the most logical answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters are male chickens and do not lay eggs. Therefore, it didn't because roosters don't lay eggs. The answer is 1

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it was too cold outside or James was not healthy, the bears would not necessarily leave James alone. If James was at a zoo, he could be surrounded by bears who are in cages and thus would just take a look at him and leave. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you take the first pill at the start, the second pill half an hour later, and the third pill half an hour after the second pill, the pills will last you for one hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Once you deduct 10 from 100, it becomes 90. After the first deduction, you are no longer subtracting 10 from 100, but from 90. Therefore the answer is 0

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one of the girls was not loved by their family or if their parent raised them differently due to the lack of money, it wouldn't change the fact that they are still twins. If they were triplets, then they were not twins. The answer is 0.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were sleeping and scared by the sound of the track, this would not result in their deaths. The rumble of the train moving the shelf and crushing them is a possibility, but there is no information implying they were crushed. Based on the mention of glass, water, and the few pieces of furniture, it suggests that Romeo and Juliet are fish, and their fish tank fell off the shelf due to the rumble of the train, causing their death. The answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The most logical choice for leading a sports team in the absence of the vice coach would be the coach. The coach is generally the most senior leadership role on a team, with the vice coach acting as support or substitute. The captain may also provide leadership, but this is usually on the field during games and wouldn't typically take the position of vice coach or coach. The management is responsible for administrative tasks and not the leading of the team during games. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The policeman did not have any evidence to know who the killer was based on their relative. The profession of being a doctor or lawyer does not mean they cannot have the name John. However, if the mail man was the only male and from the scream it was a male (John) who had the gun, then that would make the mail man the killer. The answer is 2.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): Older people living longer doesn't necessarily mean they consume more food than young people. While older adults may have specific dietary requirements to address age-related issues and require increased nutrient intake to support overall health and well-being, this doesn't inherently mean they consume more food than young people. The answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack were a fish, being knocked out of the water and unable to return would cause his death. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father, then the fat dog could be the mother. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs, only hens do. Thus, the egg laying scenario would not happen. The answer is 2.

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was a football player that can avoid rain in high speed, he still would get wet in the rain. If the man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain, it would not be possible because he did not move. If he was a photograph, he would not get wet. The answer is 2.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one mother gives her $7 to her son, there would be three people splitting the money, but both mothers are present. If they are one daughter, one mother and one grandmother, this makes up three people; thus giving each $7 would total the $21. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted phone numbers are not included in the phone directory. So, when selecting names from the phone directory, you would not select any person with unlisted numbers. Hence, the correct answer is 3 - None of above.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was lucky enough to avoid all the rain or if he was an athlete that can avoid rain in high speed, he would still get wet from the rain. If the man was in a coffin, then he would not get wet. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack and Tom are brothers who share the same parents, they would still be dividing the money between 4 people. If each kid's parents pooled $10 for division, they would be dividing the money between 5 people. If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, then the money would be divided between two people. The answer is 0

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): Black sheep do indeed need food, so that's not a viable response. Though black absorbs more heat from sunlight, that specifically doesn't cause black sheep to eat less to regulate their temperature. The fact is that there are more white sheep than black sheep in the world; therefore, white sheep consume more food. The answer is 0

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): If she tried to scare the bear or became brave suddenly, she might still feel fear due to the unpredictability of the bear's reaction. If she was at the zoo, she would not have to feel fear because there would be barriers protecting her from the bear. The answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): If John said the score would be 0-0 "before" any game starts, then he would be right. Furthermore, Tom's loss of the wager implies that John's prediction was indeed correct. The answer is 1.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): If John said the score would be 0-0 before the game starts, then he would be right. However, this might not be considered correctly predicting the "outcome" of the game, which generally refers to which team would win. John possessing an extraordinary ability to see into the future would not cause Tom to lose the bet. Tom giving his money to show his kindness would also not cause him to lose the bet. The best answer given the choices seems to be 0, but it's admittedly a tricky question as it can be interpreted in multiple ways. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The captain would be the one to lead the team if the assistant captain were to resign. The answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): After you subtract 10 from 100 once, the number is no longer 100, it becomes 90. So, you can subtract 10 from 100 only once. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If half of the sheep are white, then the total number of sheep must be even. However, there are 11 sheep which is an odd number. The only way this could be possible is if one sheep is both white and another color, making it both a part of the white sheep and not at the same time. The answer is 0.

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the officer had moved away or cut ties, James would still have a brother. However, if the officer was actually his sister, then it would make sense that James does not have a brother. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the children were boys, then males would make up all of them, not half. Regarding a child as both a boy and a girl at the same time, or raising his children in both boy and girl ways would not change their biological sex. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): The boys are living in the same house, have the same parents, were born on the same date, but they are not twins. The most logical explanation is that they could be part of a multiple birth of more than two, for instance, triplets or quadruplets. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the third man was walking on his hands, his feet would still be exposed to the wet ground. If the ground was not wet, there wouldn't be a need for the two men to wear rubber boots. Hence, by walking on stilts, the third man elevates his feet above the wet ground. This aligns with the information that his feet remain dry. So, the answer is 1.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Before any football game starts, the score is always 0-0. John could accurately predict this, so Tom lost the bet. The answer is 0.

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the dead man was the relative of both the doctor and lawyer, it would not indicate who the man named "John" was. The gender of the doctor or the lawyer would not determine who "John" was. If the mail man was the only male, then the name "John" would likely refer to him. The answer is 0

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The driver is told to make a stop, which suggests breaks. However, this does not necessarily mean that each of the stops takes half an hour. All we know is that the stops should be made every half an hour, not that they take half an hour. The duration of the stops is not provided. Therefore, none of the provided choices logically entail from the question. The answer is 3.

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the water in the tank could reflect each other or the fish had an unusual vision they would be able to see each other all the time. If the fish tank was like a ring, the fishes would be able to see each other every couple of few minutes. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question of why black sheep eat less than white sheep is an illogical comparison since the color of a sheep does not determine or affect the amount a sheep eats. The black sheep can seemingly eat less if you consider a literal scenario where there are fewer black sheep than white ones. The answer is 2.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The statement specifies that the two girls are not identical twins but they were related, their parents look alike, and they share the same birthday. The only possible answer is that they are triplets, which would mean there is another sibling. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the ground was not wet, then there would be no need for the men to wear rubber boots. If the third man is walking on stilts, his feet would indeed stay dry above the muddy ground. If the third man was walking on his hands, his feet would also stay dry but it is not a practical solution compared to the scenario where he is walking on stilts. The answer is 1.

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the fat dog was skinny before, it would not change the fact that it is the father of the thin dog. The fat dog being irresponsible and eating all the food would not change its relationship to the thin dog. If the fat dog is the mother, then it can still be the parent of the thin dog without being the father. The answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the guards were back to back, they would not be able to see each other's faces, regardless of how big the smiling guard's action was or if one of the guards had an unusual vision. If the guards were facing each other, they would be able to see each other's faces. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in every year. The answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question implies that the color of the shirt changes according to the color of the wet stone. In this case, if the stone is from Yellowstone, the shirt will become yellow. The answer is 2.

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the Lion dug a tunnel, it would still be tied to the 6m long rope and could not reach the human. If the rope stretches proportionally, it would not provide the extra length needed for the Lion to reach the human. Thus, If the other end is not tied to anything, the Lion can go as far as it wants. The answer is 1

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question asks for the number of legs on the ground. If you are laying on the bed along with two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, a goose, and three doves are fluttering above the bed, then none of their legs would be touching the ground. This leaves only the four legs of the bed on the ground. The answer is 3, None of above.

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the woman is strong enough to not get hurt from falling, 20-story fall would still cause severe injuries or death. The fireman being well exercised would not prevent the woman from getting harmed from a 20-story fall. However, if she fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside, she would not fall 20 stories and therefore would only be bruised. The answer is 1

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A superstar, a woman, or anyone else would lose their beard after shaving three times a day. However, a barber can shave other people three times a day while maintaining his own beard. Therefore, the correct answer is 1.

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Regardless of the force at which you drop the egg, a raw egg can easily crack when it falls onto a concrete floor. On the other hand, dropping an egg would not crack a concrete floor. The answer is 2

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it was nighttime and there was no source of light, the man wouldn't be able to read unless he was reading braille. But the fact that he is described as reading happily suggests that he's not pretending to read. If it were daytime, there would be natural light to read by. The answer is 0

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air, nor built on the island, then it could have been driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, then the English teacher and the history teacher would not be able to understand the test regardless of whether they have a friend from France or can use a translator. If the math teacher got the test, they would be able to understand it because numbers are the same in every language. The answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man was too exhausted and forgot his way, or if the next week was a national holiday, these situations would not explain how he could ride back on Sunday when he left on Friday. However, if his horse was named Sunday, this would allow for him to have ridden out of town on Friday and rode back on "Sunday" - his horse. The answer is 0.

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Neither throwing the glass ball hard nor gently guarantees that it won't shatter when it hits the brick wall. Moreover, the hardness of the bricks does not matter in this scenario. Hence, none of the given options logically entail the suitability. The answer is 3.

Question 72: Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Emily is adopted or she and William share the same father but not mother, Lisa could still be Emily's niece if Lisa was the child of another sibling. If Lisa is Emily's daughter, she wouldn't be Emily's niece, but she would still be William's niece. The answer is 0.

Question 73: In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not provide information about the priorities of the cops. It does not specify whether they would prioritize money, crucial documents, or jewels. Therefore, the answer cannot logically be inferred from the question. The answer is 3.

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the history teacher had a friend from France or the English teacher had experience using a translator, it would not necessarily mean they could understand French. In mathematics, numbers are universally understood, regardless of the language. Therefore, the math teacher would be able to understand the test. The answer is 2.

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man jumped off a 50-story building from the top, he would get hurt regardless of immediate medical attention or the height of the building relative to his size. The only logical way for him not to get hurt is if he jumped off from the ground floor. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the boy was only on the first step of the ladder, he would not have far to fall and therefore would not get hurt. The height of the ladder itself does not determine the height from which he fell. The answer is 2.

Question 77: You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the tide comes in, then the boats would float again which is the time the villagers would use them. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 78: He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A businessman, a publisher, or a writer all potentially could have written words. However, if a person has authored countless books but has never written a single word, they could be a dictating author, like an orator who has their spoken words transcribed. None of the given choices exactly fits this scenario. The answer is 3

Question 79: In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man were pretending to read the book, he would not actually be reading. If it were daytime, then the house would not be without lights at all. If the man were blind and reading braille, then he would be able to read without any light. The answer is 1.

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the station wasn't fixed in the marina, the boat could drift out to sea. Dolphins wouldn't be able to untie knots, and powerful waves pushing the boat and marina together would not lead to the boat being in the middle of the ocean. The answer is 0.

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall, it will break whether you drop it gently or drop it hard. The concrete floors are irrelevant to the situation. The answer would therefore be - None of above, choice 3.

Question 82: You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the people on the boat jumped into the sea, it would be dangerous and unlikely. The boat being big enough for everyone to hide seems implausible for all to do so in a moment. However, if all the people are in relationships, then you wouldn't see a "single" person on the boat, playing on the double-meaning of the word. The answer is 2.

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea does not change the color of the shirt by the mere action of the throw or the water in the Red Sea. Moreover, the Red Sea's name is not due to the water being red. Thus, the shirt would remain white. The answer is 1.

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the coffee shops and his home were on a slope, it would not explain why he visits the first coffee shop in the morning and the second one in the evening on his way back home. The distances of the coffee shops have been given, so being "too far away" does not hold up logically as he visits both on a daily basis. The phrasing of the question indicates that the worker's visits are connected to the times and his commute to and from work. The reason for his coffee visits pattern being unexplained among the options, the answer is 3

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?
Model Answer (Wrong): None of the choices logically entail the scenario in the question. If all the people left the restaurant, there would be available tables. The size of the restaurant or the relationships status of the people don't connect with the situation of having no available table. There could be a possible scenario where the tables are booked but not yet occupied, but this scenario is not provided in the choices. Therefore, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the young man fell off a 100-foot ladder and was unharmed, it suggests that he didn't fall from a significant height. The only logical scenario would be if he was only on the first step when he fell. The answer is 1.

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question stated that "Mary's father has five children," which means Mary is one of the children. The other four have been named as Nana, None, Nine, and Non. Hence, the fifth child's name is Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question is asking which room the policemen would put out the fire in first. However, firefighters, not policemen, would be the appropriate responders to a fire. Therefore, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): To solve this problem, we can set up an equation. If the runner runs X kilometers on the first day, then he runs X+2 kilometers the second day, X+4 the third day, X+6 the fourth day, and X+8 the fifth day. The sum of these should equal 70 kilometers. So the equation would be X+(X+2)+(X+4)+(X+6)+(X+8)=70. Solving this equation, we find that X, the distance covered on the first day, is 10 kilometers, which is not an option in the multiple-choice answers. Therefore, the answer is 3, "None of above".

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the pieces of the tractor fell within hail to the island or floated over the lake, then they would still need to be transported to the island by boat or plane somehow. If the tractor was driven over in winter, when the lake was frozen, then it would not need to be transported by boat or plane or be constructed on the island. The answer is 2.

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fisherman managed to catch 30 fish in 5 days by catching three more fish each day than the day before. This forms a sequential pattern. Working backward from 30, if the fifth day was three more than the fourth, the fourth day was nine fish. The third day would therefore be six fish, the second day three fish, and the first day indeed zero fish. This indicates the the answer is not listed in the choices provided. The right answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack were adopted or if Jack and Tony shared the same father but not the mother, it wouldn't change the fact that Tony's nephew would still be Jack's nephew. However, if Tony's nephew is Jack's son, then Jack would not refer to his own son as his nephew. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one bird was shot, the noise of the gunshot would likely scare the other birds away, leaving no birds on the fence. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man were a superstar or always finished his dish without any waste, he would still need to pay for his meal at the restaurant. However, if he works at the restaurant, it is possible that he gets his meals for free as part of his employment benefits. The answer is 0.

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some daughters get married and have their own family, or some brothers were not loved by family and moved away, the total number of Mrs. Jones' children wouldn't change. If each daughter shares the same brother, then Mrs. Jones would indeed only have five children. The answer is 2.

Question 96: You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that there are five organization heads in the room. If we consider each person as one head, regardless of their status or position, then the answer is 1

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): A national holiday does not affect the days of the week, and a hotel being expensive would not change the day. If the horse was named Sunday, then it would make sense for the man to "leave town on Sunday" and "ride back the next day on Sunday". The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the first or second train station was too far away, it would not explain why the student always boards at one and exits at the other. However, if the stations and his home are on a hill, the student could ride down easily on his scooter, which explains why he boards at one station in the morning and exits at the other in the afternoon. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If each player shares the same coach, then there would only be six participants in total. The answer is 0

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Emily was adopted or if Emily and William share the same father but not mother, Lisa could still be Emily's niece. 
If Lisa is Emily's daughter, she would also be William's niece, which contradicts the information given. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The first train station is only one mile away, so it is not too far. The second train station is two miles away but since he only rides the scooter in the morning and boards at the first stop, distance should not be an issue. Therefore, the stations and his home might be on a hill, which allows him to ride down easily on his scooter. The answer is 1.

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?
Model Answer (Wrong): As firemen, they would not have the authority to make any arrests, regardless of the situation. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Question 103: If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the rope stretches proportionally, it would not be enough for the dog to reach the bone. The dog digging a tunnel also does not allow it to reach the bone 7 meters away. If the other end of the rope is not tied to anything, then the dog can move freely. The answer is 0.

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it were daytime, Jessica would not be reading in complete darkness. If Jessica was pretending to read a book, she would not be reading in complete darkness. However, if Jessica is blind and she can braille, she would be able to read in complete darkness. The answer is 2.

Question 105: A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If next week was a national holiday or the hotel room was so expensive that the man came back directly, these would not explain why the man rode out on Sunday and back on Sunday after staying a whole night. If his horse was called Sunday, then he could ride out and back on "Sunday" no matter what day it was. The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Amy is so well exercised that she can reach to the base in a second to catch the pet, the pet should still have been harmed from the fall. The pet being strong enough to not get hurt from falling is not realistic given the height of the 17th floor. If the pet dog fell back into her apartment then it would not be harmed. The answer is 2.

Question 107: Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You shoot one. How many are there left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you shoot one bird, the noise would scare the rest away, so there would be none left. The answer is 3

Question 108: He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A lawyer, a teacher, and a preacher might all interact with women in their professional capacities. However, the phrase "has married many women" most likely refers to conducting wedding ceremonies rather than being a spouse in the marriage. A preacher conducts wedding ceremonies, thus "marrying" many women to their partners. The answer is 1

Question 109: Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names. What is the name of the fifth child?
Model Answer (Wrong): The information provided in the question mentions that "Mary's father is the father of five children." It further gives the names of four children: Nana, None, Nine, and Non. The fifth child mentioned at the beginning is Mary. So, the answer is 2.

Question 110: Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states that Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. If Ana's school has 4 students and three of them are Maria, James, Jonghyun, then the fourth student must be Ana. The answer is 1.

Question 111: A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a bruise. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the woman was strong, a 20-story fall would hurt her. The fireman could not have reached the woman in a second if he was 100 yards away. If she fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside, then she would not be hurt more than a bruise because she did not fall 20 stories. The answer is 1

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman does not typically grow a beard. A superstar's shaving habits would not necessarily result in them growing a beard. A barber, however, can shave other people's beards three times a day and still grow their own beard. The answer is 1.

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the students hadn't learned English, they would struggle to complete the assignments, even with translation tools or prior knowledge. As there is no language barrier in math, if Tom were a math teacher, the students would be able to complete their homework without understanding English. The answer is 1.

Question 114: If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?
Model Answer (Wrong): Throwing a white shirt into the Red Sea does not necessarily change the color of the shirt. The Red Sea's name does not denote a red color of water. The shirt might get wet, but it does not automatically become red. Therefore, the shirt remains white. The answer is 2.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The phrase "not a single person" could be a play on words. If all the people on the boat are in relationships, then there is "not a single person" on the boat. The answer is 2.

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): With the given information, we can set up the equation as: 
1st day = x
2nd day = x + 3
3rd day = x + 6 
4th day = x + 9 
5th day = x + 12

Adding all these up, we get 5x + 30 = 30 

Solving for x (the number of fish he caught on the first day), we get x = 0. 

However, none of the given options match this solution. So, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the internet was disconnected, he would not be able to search anything on Google. The answer is 2.

Question 118: He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?
Model Answer (Wrong): A teacher and a lawyer do not traditionally wed people. A preacher, however, often performs wedding ceremonies for numerous couples but does not wed himself during these ceremonies. The answer is 1

Question 119: You walk into a room and see a bed and lie on it. On the bed, there are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose. There are also three doves flying above the bed. How many legs are on the floor?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question asks about the number of legs "on the floor". It didn't ask for the number of legs of all animals in the room. So the number of legs on the floor are the four legs of the bed and the two legs of the person, making it a total of six legs. The answer is 1.

Question 120: Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some brothers were not loved by family and moved away, or some daughters got married and have their own family, Mrs. Jones would still have more than five children. However, if each daughter shares the same brother, Mrs. Jones would have four daughters and one son, making a total of five children. The answer is 2.
