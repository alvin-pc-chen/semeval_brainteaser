System Prompt: You are a Question Answering Model that answers questions by finding logical entailments between the question and answer choices.
User Prompt: Question: A horse is tied to a five-meter rope in front of an old saloon. Ten meters behind the horse is a bale of hay. Without breaking his rope, the horse is able to eat the hay whenever he chooses. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The rope stretches proportionally, providing the extra length needed for the horse to reach the hay ten meters away.; 1 = The rope is not tied to anything else.; 2 = The walls of the saloon retract or collapse inwards, creating more space for the horse to reach the hay.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Rope generally cannot stretch, and if it could stretch the length would be variable. If the walls collapse, the horse would be further from the hay. The rope not being tied to anything else is the simplest answer. The answer is 1
                Question: A woman who lives in new york legally married three men, she did not get divorce, get an enrollment, or legally seperate. How is this possible?
                Choices: 0 = The woman is not a good person.; 1 = His husband is not a good husband.; 2 = She is a minister.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: In new york it is not legal to be married to more than one person at a time, even if her husband is bad. If the woman did not get divorced or legally separated, she cannot be legally married to more than one person. Ministers perform marriages, they do not get married. The answer is 2
                Question: Brad began by entering the office tower's 22nd story through the filthy common window. He slid the window open and leapt through it after becoming depressed. Outside the building, there was a cliff-like drop to the ground. Amazingly, he came to rest entirely unharmed. How could he have survived the fall if there was nothing to slow or cushion his descent?
                Choices: 0 = Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside.; 1 = The ground outside the building is wet.; 2 = Consistent exercise has made him a very strong man.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Even very strong men would not survive a fall from a 22-story building. The ground outside the building being wet would not cushion his fall. Brad was so sick and tired of window washing, he opened the window and jumped inside. The answer is 0
                Question: Danny had just passed under an overpass in his semi when he abruptly came to a stop. Danny accidentally drove under the overpass that was only just tall enough for his truck because he wasn't paying enough attention. He was unable to move forward or backward in the semi due to how tightly it was wedged. When another tracker passed by, he was told how simple it would be to remove the semi from underneath the bridge. What did he recommend?
                Choices: 0 = He told Danny to left the bridge.; 1 = He told Danny to overturn the track.; 2 = He told Danny to let some air out of his tires.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: The bridge would not be lifted. Overturning the truck would not help. Letting some air out of his tires would help. The answer is 2
                Question: I excavate little caves and keep my gold and silver there. I also create gold crowns and silver bridges. They are the tiniest things you can imagine. Everyone will eventually require my assistance, but many people are reluctant to accept it. Why?
                Choices: 0 = I am a dentist.; 1 = I am a thief.; 2 = I am a miner.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Thieves and miners do not create gold crowns or bridges. Tiny crowns and bridges are dental work. People don't like going to the dentist. The answer is 0
                Question: Each of the 30 participants in the masquerade had to wear a unique hat to distinguish themselves from one another. The host, however, only tallied 29 when he counted the number of hats to determine attendance. All 30 persons had signed their names on the spreadsheet, which confused him. He repeated the count. There are still 29. How is that even doable?
                Choices: 0 = One person had a pretty beautiful hat.; 1 = The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it.; 2 = One person had moved away from the group when the host was counting.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If one person had a pretty beautiful hat, then the host would still count 30 hats. If one person had moved away from the group when the host was counting, then the host would still count 30 hats. The host had a hat himself and he forget to count it. The answer is 1
                Question: A certain kind of animal has parents but no children, lives happily but can not give birth to offspring. This kind of animal has existed on earth for a long history. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The animal is the dinosaur. Millions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but eventually, they became extinct due to various factors such as climate change or asteroid impact.; 1 = The animal is the butterfly. During the pupal stage of their life cycle, butterflies are inside a protective casing, and it may appear as if they have completely disappeared or been wiped out.; 2 = The animal is the Mule. Since all Mules are born sterile, you can only get a Mule by crossing a donkey with a horse.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: Dinosaurs are no longer alive, so they cannot live happily. Butterflies can give birth to offspring, so they are not the answer. Mules are born sterile, so they cannot give birth to offspring. The answer is 2
                Question: Six women were hiking on a trail when a sudden snowfall began. Five of the women hurried along, but the sixth did not. Still, they all reached the cabin at the same time, and all but the sixth were cold. How is that possible?
                Choices: 0 = The 6th woman beated them at the end.; 1 = The sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying.; 2 = The 6th woman walked slowly to dodge the snow.; 3 = None of above.;
                Response: If the sixth woman beat them or walked slowly to dodge the snow she would not have reached the cabin at the same time. If the sixth woman was in a photograph that one of the others was carrying, then she would not be cold and would not have to hurry. The answer is 1


Question 1: In a small village, two farmers are working in their fields - a diligent farmer and a lazy farmer. The hardworking farmer is the son of the lazy farmer, but the lazy farmer is not the father of the hardworking farmer. Can you explain this unusual relationship?
Model Answer (Wrong): The lazy farmer not being a responsible father or the diligent farmer forgetting his father does not explain the relationship. The lazy farmer being his mother does explain the relationship. The answer is 0.

Question 2: Romeo and Juliet are discovered dead on the bedroom floor. Glass shards and some water were on the floor when they were found. A bookcase and a bed are the sole pieces of furniture in the space. Other than the neighboring railroad track, the house is located in a rural area. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were sleeping and scared by the sound of the train, they would not necessarily die. If the rumble of the train moved the shelf and crushed them, there would likely be evidence of a fallen bookcase, which is not mentioned. Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive, fits the description given in the question. The answer is 2.

Question 3: How many years in your life it happens that before your birthday you'd be one year younger than tomorrow
Model Answer (Wrong): This situation describes the day before your birthday, which occurs each year. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 4: Who would serve as the team's captain if a crucial assistant captain departed from a sporting organization?
Model Answer (Wrong): In a sporting organization, if an assistant captain leaves, the captain remains the captain. The answer is 1.

Question 5: In one city, 5% of the population has an unlisted phone number. How many persons will have unlisted phone numbers if you pick 100 names at random from that city's phone directory?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you pick 100 names from that city's phone directory, none of the numbers would be unlisted. This is because all numbers in a phone directory are listed. The answer is 3.

Question 6: Two sentries were on duty outside a barracks. One faced up the road to watch for anyone approaching from the North. The other looked down the road to see if anyone approached from the South. Suddenly one of them said to the other, "Why are you smiling?" How did he know that his companion was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards would not be able to see each other's actions or faces if they were back to back. Unusual vision or big actions do not change this. However, if they were looking in opposite directions and facing each other, they would be able to see each other's faces. The answer is 0.

Question 7: A man wagered $50 on his dog's ability to jump higher than a house. The neighbor took the wager, thinking it was impossible, and lost. Why did he fail to win the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dogs, regardless of their species, cannot jump higher than a house. The size of the house is not mentioned as being tiny. However, a house can't jump. The answer is 0.

Question 8: How many times can you divide 100 by 10?
Model Answer (Wrong): The first division of 100 by 10 gives 10, and the second division of 10 by 10 gives 1. After that, any further divisions would only yield zero, so the answer is 2.

Question 9: In a city, there are so many criminals that police cannot catch all of them and fit them in their prisons. This number is approximately 10% of the population of the city but no names are available. To start catching the rest of the criminals police starts checking the list of criminals they have in the prisons namebook with 200 names, and go out searching for the rest wandering in the city. How many can they find?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question states "no names are available" for the criminals not yet apprehended, so regardless of the namebook, police wouldn't be able to definitively identify any more criminals beyond those they already have. The correct answer is 3.

Question 10: When did Christmas and New Year's Day fall on the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas and New Year's Day always fall in the same year. The answer is 1.

Question 11: A conscientious farmer formerly provided food for his roosters each day, but throughout the years, not a single egg was produced for him. How is it even imaginable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters will not eat their own eggs, and even if the neighbor stole the eggs, there would still be eggs produced. Roosters do not lay eggs. The answer is 1

Question 12: Mark was in a playground where somebody noticed a great player playing and with the announcements, gathered a lot of people. There were many great players from basketball, volleyball, football, and even swimmers, But Mark directly went to the footballer and took a photo with him. How did he know who was the person that people got excited for in the first place?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if Mark were a football fan, it would not guarantee that he knew the athlete people were excited about was a footballer. Being closest to the football players would not necessarily mean he knew which player people were excited about. The only factor that would lead him directly to the footballer is if the playground were a football playground at the time of the announcement, meaning the other players could not have been the subjects of the announcement. The answer is 0.

Question 13: There were five men at church, and it started raining while they were outside. The four that ran still got wet, but the one that was still stayed completely dry. Why did he stay dry?
Model Answer (Wrong): It is impossible to avoid all the rain even if the man is an athlete or is lucky. If he was in a coffin the other men were at his funeral, then he would not get wet. The answer is 2.

Question 14: On a Sunday afternoon, a woman spotted a bear in the distance. Rather than be afraid, she ran toward it excited. Why wasn't she afraid?
Model Answer (Wrong): She can't become brave all of a sudden or try to scare the bear herself. The safest answer is that she was at the zoo. The answer is 0.

Question 15: A man bet his friend that he can jump the distance from one house to another one. He won the bet. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if he is a jumping athlete, the distance between two houses is normally too far to jump. If one house is much higher than another, he would fall rather than fly. If two houses were wall-to-wall next to each other, he could jump the distance. The answer is 1.

Question 16: "The attorney is my brother," testified the accountant. But the attorney testified he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the attorney had moved away or cut ties with his brother, he would still have a brother. The accountant being his sister would mean that neither were lying about having or not having a brother. The answer is 1.

Question 17: "The attorney is my brother," the accountant testified. However, the attorney claimed that he did not have a brother. No one is lying, why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the attorney had moved away when he was young or was angry with his brother, he would still technically have a brother. However, if the accountant was a sister, it would explain the attorney's claim of not having a brother. The answer is 0.

Question 18: Shopping is done by two mothers and two daughters. They divide the $21 they have equally amongst themselves. How is this even conceivable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one mother gave her $7 to her son, then the money would not be divided equally among two daughters and two mothers. If two daughters shared the $7, they would each get $3.50 and there would still be some money left undivided. If there is one daughter, one mother and one grandmother, then they are two mothers and two daughters at the same time (the grandmother is also a mother and the mother is also a daughter). Each can have $7. The answer is 2.

Question 19: A man has 9 children. Half of them are boys. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If half of the man's 9 children are boys, then the only way this would be possible is if all the children are boys. The first two choices are unlikely and would not generally be considered. The answer is 2.

Question 20: You go to the doctor because you're sick, and he gives you three medicines to take every half hour. How long do the drugs keep you going?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first medicine right away, the second one half an hour later, and the third one at the one-hour mark. Therefore, the medicines last for an hour. The answer is 2.

Question 21: A guy bet his neighbor 50 bucks that his dog could jump higher than a house. Thinking this was not possible, the neighbor took the bet and lost Why did he lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if a house is small or a dog is a skilled jumper, typically a dog cannot jump over a house. As the logical answer, houses cannot jump at all. The answer is 0.

Question 22: A group of students plan to go trekking in the afternoon, but one of them forgets to bring their rubber boots. But how is it possible that his feet are still dry after a lengthy stroll around the park?
Model Answer (Wrong): Walking on hands for a lengthy stroll would be highly unlikely and walking on stilts does not guarantee dry feet. If the ground is not wet, then the student's feet would remain dry even without rubber boots. The answer is 0.

Question 23: There was a farmer who wanted to go investigate a problem with his chicken coop. As soon as he arrived, he saw a rooster perched atop the barn. Now the barn had a top that resembled a triangle. However, the rooster unexpectedly laid an egg. How did it roll on that side?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters don't lay eggs, so it wouldn't have rolled on any side of the barn. The answer is 1.

Question 24: James was surrounded by several hungry bears, but the bears approached me just took a look and left. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If it was too cold, bears might still be hungry. James's health would likely not deter hungry bears. If James was at the zoo, the bears would be kept from getting too close. The answer is 0.

Question 25: You go to the doctor because you're ill, and he prescribes you three pills and tells you to take them every half hour. How long do the pills last you?
Model Answer (Wrong): You take the first pill right away, the second half an hour later, and the third half an hour after that. So the pills last for an hour. The answer is 1.

Question 26: How many times can you deduct 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Once you deduct 10 from 100, it is no longer 100. Therefore, you can only deduct 10 from 100 once. The answer is 0.

Question 27: The teacher asked the two girls who looked exactly like the following questions: a.) Are you from the same family? b.) Do you have the same parents? c.) Were you born on the same day? They answered truthful "yes" to those questions, and yet told the truth when they indicated they were not twins. How can this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the girls answered yes to all those questions but are not twins, the only logical explanation is that they are triplets. So the answer is 0.

Question 28: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?
Model Answer (Wrong): The rumble of the train is unlikely to cause a shelf to crush people. Their fear of train noise would not kill them. The scenario is consistent with Romeo and Juliet being fish, the rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and they did not survive. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Question 29: If the vice coach of a sports team is unable to attend a game, who is supposed to lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): The vice coach is usually the second in command after the main coach. In case the vice coach is not present, the main coach would run the team. The answer is 0.

Question 30: A cop was walking past a restaurant when he heard someone scream - "No John, not the gun!" He ran inside and and saw a doctor, a lawyer, a mail man, and a dead body on the floor. He promptly walked over to the mail man and arrested him. He didn't witness the shooting and there was no apparent evidence to prove who shot the person and no one told him who the killer was. How did the policeman instantly know it was the mail man?
Model Answer (Wrong): The gender of the people present does not determine whether or not they committed a crime. The names of the doctor or lawyer do not determine whether or not it was the mail man. The question says nothing about the dead man being relative to both doctor and lawyer. The answer is 2. The mail man was the only male. The doctor and lawyer were females.

Question 31: Why do old people consume more food than young people.
Model Answer (Wrong): Older people do not necessarily consume more food than young people. They may require increased nutrient intake to support their health, but this does not mean more volume of food. The answer is 3.

Question 32: A sudden wave knocked Jack out of the water when he was swimming on the beach; he died five minutes later. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being scared of water would not lead to someone's death in of itself, and needing to go to the hospital still requires an initial cause of death. Jack is a fish in the ocean, and fishes cannot survive outside water. Hence, being knocked out of the water would cause a fish to die. The answer is 2.

Question 33: A large dog and a slim dog are sitting on a porch. The small dog is the fat dog's kid, but the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. Could you please explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog could not have been the father when it was thin because the question specifically states that the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. The fat dog eating all the food does not affect the familial relationships. The fat dog could be the mother, explaining why the fat dog is not the thin dog's father. The answer is 2.

Question 34: There was a farmer who had a problem with his chicken coop, and he wanted to go check it out. When he got there he noticed that there was a rooster on top of the barn. Now the barn was shaped with a triangle-type top. But suddenly the rooster laid an egg. Which side did it roll on?
Model Answer (Wrong): Roosters do not lay eggs. Therefore, the egg would not roll down either side. The answer is 2

Question 35: Five people were at a football match, and a sudden shower started. The four that rushed to take cover still got soaked, but the one who didn't move stayed completely dry. Why didn't he get wet?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even an excellent football player or a lucky man can't avoid getting soaked in the rain, so options 0 and 1 are invalid. The only logical inference is that "he" refers to a photograph, which can't get wet from the rain if it's covered or inside. The answer is 2.

Question 36: Two mothers and two daughters go shopping. They have $21, which they split equally between them. How can this be possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If they were four distinct individuals, they would not be able to split $21 equally as it does not divide evenly. One daughter and one mother would require $14, not $21. If there is a grandmother, a mother (who is also a daughter to the grandmother) and a daughter (who is a daughter to the mother), that makes two mothers and two daughters but only three individuals. They can split $21 equally. The answer is 2.

Question 37: In a certain city, 5% of all the persons in town have unlisted phone numbers. If you select 100 names at random from that city's phone directory, how many people selected will have unlisted phone numbers?
Model Answer (Wrong): People with unlisted phone numbers would not be in the phone directory, so none of the people selected from the phone directory would have unlisted phone numbers. The answer is 3.

Question 38: There were five guys in church, and it began to rain while they were outside. The four that fled got wet, while the one that remained dry kept entirely dry. Why didn't he drink?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the man was lucky or able to run fast, he would still get wet. If he was in a coffin, then he would not get wet. The answer is 0.

Question 39: Shopping is done by Jack, Tom and their parents. They divided the $40 they have equally amongst themselves. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If each kid's parents pooled $10 for division, they would have more than $40. If Jack and Tom are brothers who share the same parents, they would not have enough money to divide equally. If Jack and Tom are the parents themselves, then the division makes sense as they are only four persons in total. The answer is 0

Question 40: Why do white sheep consume more food than black sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): All sheep need food, regardless of their color. If black sheep absorbed more heat from the sunlight, they would not necessarily eat less. There are less black sheep in the world than white. The answer is 0.

Question 41: A woman spotted a bear in the distance on a Sunday afternoon. She ran in excitement toward it as opposed to being afraid. Why didn't she feel fear?
Model Answer (Wrong): If she became brave suddenly or tried to scare the bear, there could still be fear. If she was at a zoo, then there would be barriers between her and the bear. The answer is 1.

Question 42: Tom and John made a $100 wager that John could correctly predict the outcome of the upcoming football game. Tom concurs, but he loses the wager. What led Tom to lose the wager?
Model Answer (Wrong): John's ability to see the future is not realistic or relevant. If Tom gave his money to John out of kindness, this doesn't explain why Tom lost the wager. However, if John predicted the score would be 0-0 "before" the game started, he would technically be right since this is always the score before any game starts. So the answer is 1.

Question 43: Tom and John bet $100 on John correctly predicting the outcome of the forthcoming basketball game. Tom agrees, but he loses the bet. What caused Tom to lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John does not have an extraordinary ability to see into the future within the context, and Tom did not give his money away to be kind. John said the score would be 0-0 and he was right. "Before" any basketball game starts, the score is always 0-0. The answer is 0.

Question 44: If an essential assistant captain of a sports team were resigned, who would lead the team?
Model Answer (Wrong): In sports teams, if the assistant captain is unable to fulfill his duties, the captain typically steps in. The term "first officer" and "second officer" are not typical designations in a sports team. Therefore, the answer is 0.

Question 45: How many times can you subtract 10 from 100?
Model Answer (Wrong): Subtracting 10 from 100 only technically happens once since after you subtract 10 once, it is no longer 100. The answer is 2.

Question 46: A farmer has 11 sheep. Half of them are white. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If half of the sheep are white, then all sheep must be white because half of an odd number would result in a fraction. Therefore, the answer must be that they are all white. The answer is 2

Question 47: The officer arrested James and said I don't have a brother anymore, however, James also didn't have a brother. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Whether the officer was unloved by his family or had severed ties with his brother does not affect James's sibling status. However, if the officer is James's sister, the statement makes sense because the sister does not have a brother, and James does not have a brother either. The answer is 2.

Question 48: A man has nine kids. Males make up half of them. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Assuming traditional binary gender definitions, a child cannot be both boy and girl at the same time, and raising children 'in both boy way and girl way' does not affect their gender. It is possible for all nine children to be boys, which would mean males make up half of them, as well as the other half. The answer is 2.

Question 49: The coach asked the two boys who looked remarkably similar the following questions: a.) Do you live in the same house? b.) Do you have the same mother and father? c.) Were you both born on the same date? The boys responded truthfully with "yes" to these inquiries, yet were honest when they said they weren't twins. How could this be?
Model Answer (Wrong): If their parents raised them differently due to lack of money or one of the boys was not loved by their family, that wouldn't change the fact that they would still be twins if they were born on the same date. The only reasonable explanation is that they were triplets. The answer is 0.

Question 50: Three men are walking across a green and fuscous field. Only two of them are wearing rubber boots and yet the feet of the third man remains dry. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the third man was walking on his hands, his feet might not be directly in contact with the ground, but they might still get wet from the rain or splashes. Walking on stilts could indeed keep a person's feet dry, but if the field was wet enough for the first two men to require rubber boots, it's unlikely he would be able to use stilts without slipping and falling. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the ground is not wet. The answer is 0.

Question 51: John bet Tom $100 that he can predict the score of the football game before it starts. Tom agrees but loses the bet. Why did Tom lose the bet?
Model Answer (Wrong): John having an extraordinary ability to see into the future seems impossible within natural capabilities. Tom giving his money away does not answer the question. The football game score is always 0-0 before it starts. The answer is 0

Question 52: When a cop was going through a restaurant, he heard someone yell, "No John, not the gun!" He dashed inside, where he discovered a doctor, a lawyer, a priest, and a dead corpse on the floor. He quickly approached the man and arrested him. He was not present when the shooting occurred, there was no obvious evidence to indicate who shot the guy, and no one notified him who the killer was. How did the cop recognize the milan so quickly?
Model Answer (Wrong): The policeman would not make assumptions about a person's name based on their profession. Whether the dead man is a relative of the doctor and lawyer would not help identify the killer. However, if the mailman were the only male, it would be logical to assume he is "John" when hearing "No John, not the gun!" The answer is 0.

Question 53: A driver is told to make a stop every half an hour for the engine to cool down, for five times. How long do the stops take?
Model Answer (Wrong): The stops do not add time to the trip unless we know how long each stop lasts. Without additional information, we cannot determine the total stop time. The answer is 3

Question 54: Two fishes in a tank were swimming in the opposite directions, but they were seeing each other every couple of few minutes. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Fish cannot see what happens behind them and tank water reflection wouldn't make the fishes see each other. The only logical explanation is that the fish tank was like a ring and the fishes kept swimming in circles, seeing each other every few minutes. The answer is 1.

Question 55: Why do black sheep eat less than white sheep?
Model Answer (Wrong): Black sheep do need food to survive and their color does not affect their body temperature to this extent. Black sheep eat less than white because there are fewer black sheep than white sheep in the world. The answer is 2.

Question 56: The teacher questioned the two girls who had the same appearance: Are you related to each other? b.) Do your parents look alike? c.) Did you share the same birthday? They genuinely replied "yes" to those inquiries, and they were honest when they said they weren't identical twins. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If one of the girls were not loved by the family, it would not explain why they look alike or share the same birthday. Their parents raising them differently due to lack of money would not explain their similar appearance or shared birthday. They were triplets, which means they would have the same birthday and similar appearance, but not be twins. The answer is 0.

Question 57: Crossing a lush and muddy meadow are three men. The third man's feet are still dry despite the fact that only two of them are wearing rubber boots. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the ground was not wet, then there wouldn't be a need for the two men to be wearing rubber boots. If the third man is walking on his hands, his feet would be off the ground, but his hands would be wet. The third man by walking on stilts, could elevate his feet above the wet ground and thus keeping them dry. The answer is 1

Question 58: Two dogs are sitting on a porch - a fat dog and a thin dog. The little dog is the son of the fat dog, but the fat dog is not the father of the thin dog. Can you explain?
Model Answer (Wrong): The fat dog being thin when fathering does not change the fact that he would still be the father. The fat dog being not responsible does not change parenthood. The fat dog is the mother of the thin dog. So, the answer is 1.

Question 59: Two entries were stationed outside of a barracks. One was looking up the road for anyone arriving from the north. The other checked the road to see if anyone was approaching from the south. "Why are you smiling?" one of them asked the other. How did he find out his partner was smiling?
Model Answer (Wrong): The guards wouldn't be able to see each other's faces if they were back to back or if they smiled big. One of the guards having unusual vision is highly unlikely and not mentioned in the question. The guards were facing each other, so they were looking in opposite directions and could see each other's faces. The answer is 1.

Question 60: In what year did Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year?
Model Answer (Wrong): Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall in the same year every year, so the correct answer is 1.

Question 61: When you put a white shirt on a stone that is red and wet, it will become red, if you do the same thing for Yellowstone, what will happen?
Model Answer (Wrong): Yellowstone is a place, not a color. Therefore, the shirt won't change its color to yellow by simply being placed there. The answer is 3

Question 62: If a Lion is tied to a piece of metal that is 6m long, how can it reach a human that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if a lion could dig a tunnel, it would not be able to extend its reach. The rope could not be stretched and even if it could, the length of the rope would still be variable. If the other end of the rope is not tied to anything else, the lion can freely move towards the human. The answer is 1.

Question 63: You stroll into a room, find a bed, and lie down on it. There are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose on the bed. Three doves are also fluttering above the bed. How many legs are there on the ground?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if there were many animals on the bed, it doesn't mean their legs are on the ground. Therefore, the number of legs on the ground include your two legs and the bed's four legs. The answer is 1

Question 64: A woman who appears to be about to jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building is being caught in a net by a fireman who is running to reach her. There is a 20-story fall below her and nothing else. When she falls, the fireman is still 100 yards away and is not nearly in time. The damage to the woman is not worse than a bruise. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if the woman is strong, a fall from a 20-story building would cause severe injury or death. The fireman, no matter how well exercised, cannot cover 100 yards in a second. The woman fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside. The answer is 1.

Question 65: Who can shave three times a day and maintain a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A superstar or woman would likely not shave three times a day and maintain a beard. A barber, however, can shave other people (thus doing the action of shaving multiple times a day) and still maintain their own beard. The answer is 1.

Question 66: How can you drop a raw egg onto a concrete floor and not crack it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg gently or hard could still potentially crack it. Concrete is indeed hard and difficult to crack, so the egg cracking the floor is unlikely. The answer is 2.

Question 67: Jessica is telling her friends this story and asks them to guess if it's the truth or a lie: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights on at all. There was no lamp, no candle, and no other source of light. Yet, he sat in the house and read his book happily." Her friends say she's lying, but Jessica corrects them and says she's telling the truth. Jessica's story is true—but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man could not pretend to read the book and be happy. A blind man could not read Braille with no light. But if it was daylight, there would be light. The answer is 0.

Question 68: You are on an island in the middle of a lake. The lake is in a remote part of the country and there has never been a bridge connecting the island to the mainland. Every day a tractor and wagon gives hay rides around the island. Puzzle as to how the tractor had gotten onto the island, you ask around and find out that the tractor was not transported to the island by boat or by air. Nor was it built on the island. Explain how the tractor got there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of the tractor falling within hail to the island or floating over the lake both do not provide consistent or plausible explanations. The tractor could have been driven over in winter when the lake was frozen. The answer is 1.

Question 69: Sally has three classes, Math, English Language Arts, and History. She had a test in every class, and wanted to have some fun, so she did all of her tests in French. When she received her tests back, only one teacher could understand her work. If none of Sally's teachers spoke French, which teacher was able to understand the test and how did they understand it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Having a friend from France does not mean the history teacher understands French. Using a translator is not mentioned in the question. Numbers are the same in all languages, including French, so the math teacher could understand the test. The answer is 2.

Question 70: On Friday, the man rode out of town to pick some berries. 2 hours later, he rode back on Sunday. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The man's journey to pick berries and return home cannot influence the day of the week. The week being a national holiday would not change the days. If his horse was named Sunday, then it would be possible for him to ride out on Friday and ride back on Sunday. The answer is 0

Question 71: How can you toss a fragile glass ball against a sturdy brick wall from a distance without shattering it?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you throw the glass ball hard or gently, it would shatter when it hits the brick wall because glass is fragile. Sturdy bricks are hard to crack but that does not prevent the glass ball from shattering. None of the provided options would prevent the glass ball from shattering. So, the answer is 3.

Question 72: Lisa is William's niece, but she isn't Emily's niece—even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Lisa was Emily's daughter, she would be William's niece. Being adopted or only sharing the same father wouldn't change the fact that Emily and William are siblings. The answer is 0.

Question 73: In a house, there are three major rooms. The first is stuffed with cash. The second is stuffed with crucial documents. The third is stuffed with jewels. One day, all of these rooms caught fire. Which room did the cops initially put out the fire?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question does not give any indications that would lead to selecting one specific room over another based on the contents inside. Therefore, the question does not provide logical entailments to establish a correct answer. It is tricky because, depending on condition, cops are not the ones to put out the fire, firemen do. However, if we based on this possibility, the answer would be 3.

Question 74: Math, English language arts, and history are Sally's three subjects. Once she got an exam, she took it in French because she wanted to have fun. Only one teacher could understand her work when she received the results of her tests. Which teacher was able to grasp the test and how did they understand it since none of Sally's teachers could speak French?
Model Answer (Wrong): The history teacher having a friend from France or the English teacher using a translator does not guarantee they can understand French. Mathematics is a universal language, so a math test would be the same in French as in English. The answer is 2.

Question 75: A man jumped off a 50-story building, but he didn't get hurt at all. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even with medical attention, a person would get hurt from jumping off a 50-story building. Any building, regardless of its height, would hurt a person if they jumped off it. If he jumped off the ground floor, then he would not be hurt. The answer is 1.

Question 76: A boy fell off of a 100 foot ladder, but he did not get hurt. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): A 100-foot ladder would be tall for anyone, and if he got medical attention, then he was hurt. If he was only on the first step of the ladder when he fell, then he wouldn't be hurt. The answer is 2.

Question 77: You're visiting a village in Vietnam that you see a lot of small boats grounded, but you're wondering how they're always using their boats and now you see no water around them. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Tides in coastal areas can cause the water level to rise and fall throughout the day. When the tide is high, boats can be used. When the tide is low, boats may appear beached or grounded. The villagers probably use their boats during high tide. The answer is 0.

Question 78: He has authored countless books, but has never written a single word. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A businessman and a writer would have written at least a word in their profession. A publisher, although they put out books, do not actually write the words in them. The answer is 1

Question 79: In order for her friends to determine if the following story is true or false, Jessica tells them: "There was a man sitting in a house at night that had no lights at all. There was no candle, lamp, or other light source present. He nonetheless gladly read his book while sitting in the home. Jessica responds to her friends' accusations of lying by insisting that she is speaking the truth. Jessica's account is accurate, but how?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the man were smart or pretending to read, he would not be able to read in the dark. Although a blind man could read braille in the dark, the question states “he gladly read his book” without specifying it was in braille. The simplest answer is that it was daytime, allowing the man to read without additional light. The answer is 2.

Question 80: If a boat is parked in a marina and tied to a nearby station, how did its owner found the boat a couple of hours later in the middle of the ocean?
Model Answer (Wrong): The waves being powerful wouldn't untie the boat from the station. Dolphins wouldn't be likely to untie knots on a boat. The station not being fixed in the marina is the most plausible answer. The answer is 0.

Question 81: How can you throw a raw egg against a hard rock wall and not break it?
Model Answer (Wrong): Dropping the egg gently or hard against a wall will break it, and the hardness of concrete floors is irrelevant. The question asks how you can throw an egg against a wall and not break it, not how you can prevent the wall from cracking. None of the answers provided logically answer the question. The answer is 3.

Question 82: You're out on the water and see a boat filled with people. You look away for a second and look back again, but this time you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): People can't jump into the sea in a moment or hide themselves in a moment. The statement "you don't see a single person" can mean there are no unmarried people on the boat. All the people on the boat are in relationships. The answer is 2.

Question 83: If you paint a brown home white, it will turn white. The light is green if the spotlight switches from red to green. So, what happens if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea?
Model Answer (Wrong): The Red Sea is a body of water and will not alter the color of a white shirt thrown into it. The color of the shirt remains unchanged. The answer is 1

Question 84: An office worker usually walks to work daily. There are two coffee shops on his route; the first one is half a mile away from his house and the second one is a mile away in the opposite direction. He always stops at the first coffee shop in the morning and always visits the second one in the evening on his way back home. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the coffee shops are far away, he wouldn't be able to stop by and visit them. If the coffee shops and his home are on a slope, which allows him to walk downhill easily both to work and back home, then he can stop at both coffee shops. The answer is 0

Question 85: You wanted to reserve a table in a restaurant but they told you all their tables were already booked. however, when you're passing by, you see that there is not a single person eating in the restaurant. Why did they tell you that all their tables were fully booked?
Model Answer (Wrong): The presence or absence of people in relationships in the restaurant wouldn't affect the availability of tables. A big restaurant couldn't hide all the people so quickly, and it's also unlikely that all people left the restaurant at the same moment too. None of the choices logically answer the question. The answer is 3

Question 86: A young man fell off a 100-foot ladder, but he was unharmed. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Getting medical attention would not protect from falling off a 100-foot ladder. The ladder height is not relative to someone's size or age. If he was only on the first step, then he didn't fall far. The answer is 1.

Question 87: Mary's father has five children. They are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. What is the fifth child name?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question mentions that "Mary's father has five children", indicating that Mary is one of the five children. The other four children are Nana, None, Nine, and Non. Therefore, the fifth child must be Mary. The answer is 2.

Question 88: There are three important rooms in a house. The first one is filled with money. The second one is filled with important papers. The third one is filled with jewelry. One day all of these rooms burst into fire. Which room did the policemen put out the fire in first?
Model Answer (Wrong): A policeman is not usually in charge of putting out fires, that would typically be the role of a firefighter. The answer is 3.

Question 89: In a 5-day marathon, a professional runner runs 70 kilometers. Each day, he ran two kilometers more than the previous day. How many kilometers did the runner run on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): The runner did not run five, six, or seven kilometers on the first day. Since he ran two more each day for five days, and the total distance is 70 km, the distance of the first day could be calculated as follows:

Let’s denote x the distance ran the first day. Then he ran x+2 the second day, x+4 the third day, x+6 the fourth day, and x+8 the fifth day. The total distance is x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) = 70.

Thus, 5x + 20 = 70. Solving for x gives x = 10.

Therefore, he ran 10 kilometers on the first day. The answer is 3.

Question 90: You've found yourself on an island in the midst of a lake. The lake is in a remote area of the country, and no bridge has ever connected the island to the mainland. A tractor and wagon provide daily hay rides around the island. You inquire as to how the tractor arrived onto the island and discover that it was not carried to the island by boat or plane. It was also not constructed on the island. How did the tractor get there?
Model Answer (Wrong): The pieces of the tractor falling within hail to the island or floating over the lake are not reasonable possibilities. Depending on the climate, lakes can freeze solid in winter, allowing for heavy machinery to be driven over them. The answer is 2.

Question 91: During a 5-day competition, a professional fisherman caught 30 fish. He caught three more fish each day than the day before. On the first day, how many fish did the fisherman catch?
Model Answer (Wrong): If we add the sum of the arithmetic progression, we will get 30. The 5-day sequence with a common difference of 1 that adds up to 30 starts with 2 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The answer is 0.

Question 92: Tony and Jack are brothers and Tony is not married. However, Tony's nephew is not Jack's nephew. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Jack was adopted or Tony and Jack shared the same father but not mother, Tony's nephew would still be Jack's nephew. Tony's nephew being Jack's son is the only way for Tony's nephew not to be Jack's nephew. The answer is 0.

Question 93: There are ten birds sitting on a fence. You shoot one. How many are left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you shoot one bird, the noise would likely scare the other birds away. Therefore, none would be left. The answer is 3.

Question 94: A man goes to a restaurant everyday but he does't pay at all. How's that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Being a superstar does not exempt someone from paying at a restaurant. Finishing a dish without waste also does not mean he can eat for free. If he works at the restaurant, it's possible he may get meals as a part of his employment perks. The answer is 0

Question 95: Mrs. Jones has four daughters. Each of her daughters has one brother. But Mrs. Jones only has five children. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some daughters got married and had their own family, then Mrs. Jones would have more than five children. If brothers moved away, that still would not change Mrs. Jones's number of children. Each daughter shares the same brother is the simplest answer. The answer is 2.

Question 96: You enter a room with five of the organization' heads. All of them are there to make an important decision. How many heads are there in the room?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question suggests that you entered a room with five of the organization's heads, which means these are individuals, not literal heads. Additionally, it is stated that you entered the room. Therefore, the total number of heads (counting each person's individual head) would be six (you + five heads of the organization). However, none of the answer choices reflect this correct answer. Therefore, the answer is 3 = None of above.

Question 97: A man left town on Sunday, spent the entire night in a motel, and then rode back the next day, again on Sunday. How is that even possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if next week is a national holiday or the hotel room is expensive, it does not make it possible for the man to leave and return on the same day of the week given he stayed overnight. If his horse was called Sunday, then he could leave on Sunday and return on Sunday, even if those days are more than one day apart. The answer is 1.

Question 98: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The second train station being too far away would not explain why he exits there. The first train station is not too far away, if it was, he would not board there. The physical arrangement of locations is the most logical explanation. The answer is 2.

Question 99: A chess team have five players and each player has one coach. But there are only six participants in the team. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some players are backups and not allowed to play, there would still be more than six participants. If some coaches get a raise, that does not affect the number of participants. The simplest answer is that each player shares the same coach. The answer is 0.

Question 100: Even though Emily is William's sister and William isn't married, Lisa is William's niece but not Emily's. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even if Emily is adopted or they share the same father but not mother, Lisa still would not be William's niece but not Emily's. Lisa is Emily's daughter would be a solution as this would make Lisa William's niece and Emily's daughter, not niece. The answer is 2.

Question 101: A student leans forward while riding his scooter to the train station to go to college. Two stops are not far from his home; the first is one mile away and the second is two miles away in the opposite direction. He always boards at the first stop in the morning and always exits at the second stop in the afternoon. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): The distance to the first and second train stations is specified, so them being too far away is not logical. If the stations and his home are on a hill, he can easily ride his scooter downhill to both stations. The answer is 1.

Question 102: There was a burglary going on when firemen got to the scene first since they were not sure if there is a fire going on as well. Four people were coming out of the place, two covering their face. Who did the firemen arrest?
Model Answer (Wrong): Firemen do not have the authority to arrest anyone, so they didn't arrest anyone. The answer is 3.

Question 103: If a dog is tied to a piece of rope that is 6m long, how can it reach a bone that is 7m away?
Model Answer (Wrong): A rope typically doesn't stretch proportionally to provide extra length. The dog digging a tunnel is unlikely as the question doesn't hint that the dog can or does dig. The rope not being tied to anything allows the dog to reach the bone that's out of its rope's reach. The answer is 0.

Question 104: Each night in her bedroom, Jessica always reads in complete darkness. Her parents, however, never stop her and often send cake to reward her hard work. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Jessica is not reading in the dark if it is daytime. If Jessica pretended to be reading, then why would she read in complete darkness where it would be obvious that she wasn't reading. If Jessica is blind she would read using braille and could do so in the dark. The answer is 2.

Question 105: A man rode out of town on Sunday. He stayed a whole night at a hotel and rode back to town the next day on Sunday. How is this possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The national holiday next week or the expensive hotel room wouldn't explain the discrepancy with the days. His horse being named Sunday, however, would make it possible for him to ride out and back into town on "Sunday" without contradicting the common understanding of days of the week. The answer is 2.

Question 106: Amy was shocked to see his adorable pet dog perched on the edge of the balcony. She shouted at her pet to come back. This sudden fright made the pet immobile, and fell over the edge. Although Amy's apartment is on the 17th floor, the family dog was unharmed. How is that even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): Amy reaching the base of the building in a second to catch the pet is not possible. The pet falling from the 17th floor could get seriously hurt, regardless of how strong it is. The pet dog fell back into her apartment, jumping from the balcony into the inside would allow the pet to be unharmed. The answer is 2.

Question 107: Ten birds are perched atop a fence. You shoot one. How many are there left?
Model Answer (Wrong): If you shoot one bird, the noise will likely scare the remaining birds away. Therefore, there would be zero birds left on the fence. The answer is 3.

Question 108: He has married many women, but has never been married. Who is he?
Model Answer (Wrong): A lawyer, teacher, or preacher could all potentially marry many women. However, in the context of the question, the person who conducts wedding ceremonies is a preacher. So, the answer is 1.

Question 109: Mary's father is the father of five children. Nana, None, Nine, and Non are their names. What is the name of the fifth child?
Model Answer (Wrong): The first sentence says "Mary's father is the father of five children," which indicates that one of the children's names is Mary. We already know the names of the first four children, Nana, None, Nine, and Non. The answer is 2.

Question 110: Ana's school has 4 students in Alaska: Maria, James, Jonghyun. What is the name of other student?
Model Answer (Wrong): The question already states that the school is Ana's so it's logical to infer that Ana herself is the fourth student. The answer is 1

Question 111: A fireman is running to get a net under a lady who looks like she might jump off the balcony of her 20-story apartment building. There is nothing below her except a 20-story fall. The fireman is still 100 yards away when she falls and can't nearly get there in time. The woman is not hurt more than a bruise. How is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): Even very strong women would not survive a fall from a 20-story building. A fireman cannot travel 100 yards in a second, even if he is well exercised. If she fell back into her apartment, she would not be hurt more than a bruise. The answer is 1.

Question 112: Who can shave three times a day and still grow a beard?
Model Answer (Wrong): A woman typically does not grow a beard. A superstar may have a beard, but shaving three times a day isn't typical for anyone. A barber can shave others' beards multiple times a day, but their beard can still grow. The answer is 1

Question 113: Tom teaches in a Chinese school. One day, he handed homework to the children after printing it accidentally in English. Despite not having learned English yet, every student completed their assignments flawlessly the following day. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If the students have not learned English, they would not be able to complete the homework without assistance or translation tools. If Tom is a math teacher, the numbers would be the same regardless of the language. This would allow the students to complete their assignments flawlessly. The answer is 1.

Question 114: If you paint a brown house white it will become a white house. If the spotlight changes from red to green, then the light is green. So, if you throw a white shirt into the Red Sea, what will it become?
Model Answer (Wrong): The color of the water does not have an effect on the color of the shirt. The shirt stays the same color when it is thrown into the sea. The answer is 2.

Question 115: You're out on the sea and notice a boat full of people. You take a quick glance away and then back, but there is not a single person on the boat. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): If all the people on the boat jump into the sea, they would still be visible, not disappearing. If the boat is so big that all of the people can hide themselves in a moment, again, they would not disappear instantly. The phrase "not a single person" can be taken to mean "not a single, unattached person." If everyone on the boat is in a relationship, then there is "not a single person" there on the boat. The answer is 2.

Question 116: A professional fisherman caught 30 fish during a 5-day tournament. Each day, he caught three more fish than the day before. How many fish did the fisherman catch on the first day?
Model Answer (Wrong): If he caught three more fish each day for five days, the sequence would have to start at one to end up with a total of 30 fish. On day one, he caught one fish, on day two, four fish, on day three, seven fish, on day four, ten fish, and on day five, eight fish (1+4+7+10=30). The answer is 1

Question 117: Bob was working on a project when suddenly the internet got disconnected. He then searched google but didn't find anything. Why?
Model Answer (Wrong): Searching Google requires an internet connection, regardless of whether or not he has a membership or if he searched incorrectly. If the internet was disconnected, he couldn't search on Google. The answer is 2.

Question 118: He has wed numerous women, but never himself. He is who?
Model Answer (Wrong): A teacher and a lawyer don't typically perform marriage ceremonies. A preacher does perform marriage ceremonies, but does not marry themselves in those ceremonies. The answer is 1.

Question 119: You walk into a room and see a bed and lie on it. On the bed, there are two dogs, five cats, a giraffe, six cows, and a goose. There are also three doves flying above the bed. How many legs are on the floor?
Model Answer (Wrong): Animals or birds are not specifying whether they are on the bed or on the floor. The giraffe and the doves are not specified to be lying down, but birds and giraffes don't lay down on beds or floors. Only your legs and the bed's legs are specified to be on the floor. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Question 120: Four of Mrs. Jones' daughters exist. She has one brother for each of her daughters. Mrs. Jones, however, only has five kids. How is it even doable?
Model Answer (Wrong): If some brothers moved away or daughters got married, the total number of children would not change. If each daughter shares the same brother, then Mrs. Jones only has five children - four daughters and one son. The answer is 2.
