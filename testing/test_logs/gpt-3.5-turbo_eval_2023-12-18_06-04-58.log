How much has the woman lost?

Once there, she makes the decision to jump from the enormous height. The amazing thing is that she has never experienced an injury as a result of her leap, and she even claims to feel much better afterwards.

Model Answer (Wrong): Since Sally continued reading without any artificial lighting, Option 0 ("Because it was daytime") cannot be the correct answer as it refers to daylight. Option 2 ("Sally is smart that she pretended to be reading the book") does not provide a logical explanation.

Question 36: Dorothy has never expressed suicidal thoughts, but whenever she experiences feelings of sadness or depression, she makes arrangements to travel to a very high spot that she has visited on numerous occasions. Once there, she proceeds to jump from that great height. The fascinating fact though is she has never been injured from this leap, and in fact, she tells everyone that she feels much better afterward. If she’s not suicidal, then what is going on here, and why has she never been injured, or even worse, died from her risky actions?
Model Answer (Wrong): If Dorothy jumps from a great height and does not get injured or die, it suggests that she has some sort of safety measures in place or she is engaged in a controlled activity. If she feels better afterward, it might indicate that she gets an adrenaline rush from the experience. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that Dorothy is a sky jumper (choice 2).

Model Answer (Wrong): According to the given information, Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters. This means there are six daughters in the family. The statement also says that each daughter has one brother. Therefore, there is only one brother in the family. Combining these two statements, we can infer that the six daughters and one brother make a total of seven children in the family. Since it is stated that there are only nine people in the family, there must be two additional adults, who are most likely Mr. and Mrs. Mustard. Therefore, the answer is that some daughters get married and have their own family. The answer is 0.

Question 48: The six daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Mustard each have one brother. However, the family only consists of nine people; how is that possible?
Model Answer (Wrong): The logical answer is that each daughter shares the same brother. Since the question states that "each daughter has one brother," it implies that there is only one brother in the family. Therefore, the answer is 2.

The farmer told the authorities that the radishes came from his own farm this morning. Even though he planted radishes on his own farm, he was nonetheless detained by the police anyway. How?
Model Answer (Wrong): The farmer claimed that the radishes came from his own farm that morning. However, since the radishes were reported as stolen from the neighbor's farm, it implies that they were missing from the neighbor's farm and not harvested from the farmer's own farm. Therefore, the farmer's statement contradicts the evidence, and that is why he was detained by the police. The answer is 3.
